  abstract = {An efficient optimization method for the crystallization of biological macromolecules has been developed and tested. This builds on a successful high-throughput technique for the determination of initial crystallization conditions. The optimization method takes an initial condition identified through screening and then varies the concentration of the macromolecule, precipitant, and the growth temperature in a systematic manner. The amount of sample and number of steps is minimized and no biochemical reformulation is required. In the current application a robotic liquid handling system enables high-throughput use, but the technique can easily be adapted in a nonautomated setting. This method has been applied successfully for the rapid optimization of crystallization conditions in nine representative cases.},

  abstract       = {Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are innate immune effector molecules that are thought to confer antiviral defence through disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation-initiation machinery. However, it was recently discovered that IFITs can directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an amino-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single-stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double-stranded viral PPP-RNA, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, also known as DDX58). Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence-specific manner and requires a 5'-overhang of approximately three nucleotides. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 was found to cause a defect in the antiviral response by human embryonic kidney cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA, and lend insight into their downstream effector function.},

  abstract       = {In the current study we aimed at developing a vaccine delivery/adjuvant system to enhance anti-tumor immunity against the natural multi-epitope HER2/Neu-derived P5 peptide. Polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] is a strong immunoadjuvant able to enhance specific antitumor immunity induced by peptide-based vaccines. Nevertheless, delivering the peptide and adjuvant intracellularly into their target site remains a challenging issue. We hypothesized this barrier could be overcome through the use of a cationic nanoliposome carrier system which can carry and protect the antigen and adjuvant in the extracellular environment and augment the induction of antitumor immunity. P5 was encapsulated in cationic nanoliposomes composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP)-Cholesterol either alone or complexed with Poly (I:C). Immunocompetent BALB/c mice were immunized with the formulations 3 times in two-week intervals and the efficiency and type of immune response were then evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The groups immunized with Lip-P5+PIC (DOTAP-Cholestrol-P5+Poly (I:C)) and Lip+PIC (DOTAP-Cholestrol+Poly (I:C)) enhanced the release of Interferon (IFN)-âÃ©Â¬â¥ in comparison with other groups. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Lip-P5+PIC formulation induced the highest level of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ in CD8(+) lymphocytes. Lip-P5+PIC, Lip+PIC and Lip-P5 (DOTAP-Cholestrol-P5) provided some extent of protection in terms of tumor regression in TUBO tumor mice model during the first 65days post tumor challenge but at the end only the tumors of mice immunized with Lip-P5+PIC were significantly smaller than all other groups. Furthermore, tumors of mice receiving Lip-P5+PIC grew at a significantly slower rate throughout the observation period. Our results showed that the combination of Poly (I:C) and DOTAP with the tumor antigen and without applying additional T-helper epitope induced strong antitumor responses. The observations presented here are of great interest for future vaccine studies.},

  abstract       = {Synthetic genetics is a subdiscipline of synthetic biology that aims to develop artificial genetic polymers (also referred to as xeno-nucleic acids or XNAs) that can replicate in vitro and eventually in model cellular organisms. This field of science combines organic chemistry with polymerase engineering to create alternative forms of DNA that can store genetic information and evolve in response to external stimuli. Practitioners of synthetic genetics postulate that XNA could be used to safeguard synthetic biology organisms by storing genetic information in orthogonal chromosomes. XNA polymers are also under active investigation as a source of nuclease resistant affinity reagents (aptamers) and catalysts (xenozymes) with practical applications in disease diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we provide a structural perspective on known antiparallel duplex structures in which at least one strand of the Watson-Crick duplex is composed entirely of XNA. Currently, only a handful of XNA structures have been archived in the Protein Data Bank as compared to the more than 100 000 structures that are now available. Given the growing interest in xenobiology projects, we chose to compare the structural features of XNA polymers and discuss their potential to access new regions of nucleic acid fold space.},

  abstract       = {The development of a preventive vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection is the most efficient method to control the epidemic. The ultimate goal is to develop a vaccine able to induce specific neutralizing, non-neutralizing antibodies and cellular mediated immunity (CMI). Humoral and CMI responses can be directed to glycoproteins that are normally presented as a trimeric spike on the virus surface (gp140). Despite safer, subunit vaccines are normally less immunogenic/effective and need to be delivered together with an adjuvant. The choice of a suitable adjuvant can induce effective humoral and CMI that utterly lead to full protection against disease. In this report, we established a hierarchy of adjuvant potency on humoral and CMI when admixed with the recombinant HIV gp140 trimer. We show that vaccination with gp140 in the presence of different adjuvants can induce high-affinity antibodies, follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells. The data show that poly (I:C) is the most potent adjuvant to induce specific CMI responses evidenced by IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ production and CD4+/CD8+ T cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining some adjuvants like MPL plus Alum and MPL plus MDP exert additive effects that impact on the magnitude and quality of humoral responses while mixing MDP with poly (I:C) or with R848 had no impact on total IgG titers but highly impact IgG subclass. In addition, heterologous DNA prime- protein boost yielded higher IgG titers when compare to DNA alone and improved the quality of humoral response when compare to protein immunization as evidenced by IgG1/IgG2a ratio. The results presented in this paper highlight the importance of selecting the correct adjuvant-antigen combination to potentiate desired cells for optimal stimulation.},

  abstract       = {SwS, based on a statistical analysis of crystallographic structures deposited in the NDB, is designed to provide an exhaustive overview of the solvation of nucleic acid structural elements through the generation of 3D solvent density maps. A first version (v1.0) of this web service focuses on the interaction of DNA, RNA and hybrid base pairs linked by two or three hydrogen bonds with water, cations and/or anions. Data provided by SwS are updated on a weekly basis and can be used by: (i) those involved in molecular dynamics simulation studies for validation purposes; (ii) crystallographers for help in the interpretation of solvent density maps; and all those involved in (iii) drug design and, more generally, in (iv) nucleic acid structural studies. SwS provides also statistical data related to the frequency of occurrence of different types of base pairs in crystallographic structures and the conformation of the involved nucleotides. This web service has been designed to allow a maximum of flexibility in terms of queries and has also been developed with didactic considerations in mind.

It is designed to simplify data processing by dividing the process into a series of steps, which are normally carried out sequentially. Each step has its own display pane, allowing control over parameters that influence that step and providing graphical feedback to the user. Suitable values for integration parameters are set automatically, but additional menus provide a detailed level of control for experienced users. The image display and the interfaces to the different tasks (indexing, strategy calculation, cell refinement, integration and history) are described. The most important parameters for each step and the best way of assessing success or failure are discussed.},

  abstract       = {We have carried out an extended reference set of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations (63 simulations with 8.4 mus of simulation data) of canonical A-RNA duplexes. Most of the simulations were done using the latest variant of the Cornell et al. AMBER RNA force field bsc0chi(OL3), while several other RNA force fields have been tested. The calculations show that the A-RNA helix compactness, described mainly by geometrical parameters inclination, base pair roll, and helical rise, is sequence-dependent. In the calculated set of structures, the inclination varies from 10 degrees to 24 degrees . On the basis of simulations with modified bases (inosine and 2,6-diaminopurine), we suggest that the sequence-dependence of purely canonical A-RNA double helix is caused by the steric shape of the base pairs, i.e., the van der Waals interactions. The electrostatic part of stacking does not appear to affect the A-RNA shape. Especially visible is the role of the minor groove amino group of purines. This resembles the so-called Dickerson-Calladine mechanical rules suggested three decades ago for the DNA double helices. We did not identify any long-living backbone substate in A-RNA double helices that would resemble, for example, the B-DNA BI/BII dynamics. The variability of the A-RNA compactness is due to mutual movements of the consecutive base pairs coupled with modest change of the glycosidic chi torsion. The simulations further show that the A-RNA compactness is modestly affected by the water model used, while the effect of ionic conditions, investigated in the range from net-neutral condition to ~0.8 M monovalent ion excess salt, is smaller.},

  abstract       = {We present a novel topological classification of RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots. It is based on the topological genus of the circular diagram associated to the RNA base-pair structure. The genus is a positive integer number whose value quantifies the topological complexity of the folded RNA structure. In such a representation, planar diagrams correspond to pure RNA secondary structures and have zero genus, whereas non-planar diagrams correspond to pseudoknotted structures and have higher genus. The topological genus allows for the definition of topological folding motifs, similar in spirit to those introduced and commonly used in protein folding. We analyze real RNA structures from the databases Worldwide Protein Data Bank and Pseudobase and classify them according to their topological genus. For simplicity, we limit our analysis by considering only Watson-Crick complementary base pairs and G-U wobble base pairs. We compare the results of our statistical survey with existing theoretical and numerical models. We also discuss possible applications of this classification and show how it can be used for identifying new RNA structural motifs.},

  abstract       = {Historically, it has been assumed that double-stranded (ds) RNAs function at a cellular level exclusively via an interferon (IFN) induction mechanism. However, current studies conducted both in the laboratory and at the clinical level reveal that this assumption is incorrect and, indeed, underestimates the intrinsic antitumor activity of certain dsRNAs. A specific dsRNA (Ampligen) shows strong antiproliferative activity against human carcinoid tumor cells in a clonogenic assay when natural alpha- and beta-IFNs were inactive. Similarly, in vivo studies in which human renal cancer cells were transplanted into athymic mice demonstrate a strong antitumor effect of Ampligen whereas such tumors are largely unaffected by alpha-IFN treatment. In a comparative study including many fresh human tumors of various histological types (breast, ovarian, melanoma, renal, and carcinoid) numerous examples were uncovered of Ampligen sensitivity (antiproliferative effect) in the face of relative or complete insensitivity to IFNs. Synergistic effects of Ampligen plus IFN overcame the resistance of some human tumor cells to either biological modifier given alone. It can also be demonstrated that the antitumor action of Ampligen on certain human lung tumor cells is not shared by polyinosinic . polycytidylic acid, thus indicating that different dsRNAs may themselves exhibit dissimilar effects on various human tumors.},

  abstract       = {Historically, double-stranded (ds) RNAs have been largely over-looked as potentially valuable anticancer/antiviral drugs, primarily because of the many clinical toxicities and lack of efficacy associated with the first clinically tested dsRNA--polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (rIn X rCn). However, studies summarized herein demonstrate that the therapeutic ratio of dsRNAs can be greatly enhanced by purposeful mispairing of bases. For example, a mispaired dsRNA, termed Ampligen (rIn X r(C12,U)n), shows strong antitumor activity in a variety of relevant test systems with little or none of the toxicities associated with rIn X rCn. Furthermore, Ampligen demonstrates a much wider therapeutic spectrum than that displayed to date by any single type of interferon (natural or recombinant DNA-derived). Importantly, Ampligen, the product of a straight-forward enzymatic synthesis, shows excellent lot-to-lot biological and biophysical specifications, which is often not the case with biologically derived new compounds. Furthermore, a significant fraction of human solid tumors, which are largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy or interferon (IFN), is sensitive to Ampligen in a fresh human tumor clonogenic assay. Indeed, whereas 50% of untreated and IFN-treated athymic mice engrafted with human renal cancer cells die within 20-22 weeks, mice treated with Ampligen survive a minimum of 32 weeks (p less than 0.0003). A summary of all animal models tested and human clinical trials to date demonstrates that Ampligen exerts a greater antitumor activity than IFN and has a superior therapeutic ratio compared to rIn X rCn.},

  abstract       = {Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are stromal precursors endowed with extensive immunomodulative properties. In this study, we aimed to assess whether Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-activated BM-MSC influence human neutrophil (PMN) responses under coculture conditions. We show that TLR3 triggering by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid dramatically amplifies, in a more significant manner than TLR4 triggering by lipopolysaccharide, the antiapoptotic effects that resting BM-MSC constitutively exert on PMN under coculture conditions, preserving a significant fraction of viable and functional PMN up to 72 hours. In addition, TLR3- and TLR4-activated BM-MSC enhance respiratory burst ability and CD11b expression by PMN. The coculture in the absence of cell contact and the incubation of PMN in supernatants harvested from TLR3- and TLR4-activated BM-MSC yield comparable results in terms of increased survival and immunophenotypic changes, thus suggesting the involvement of endogenous soluble factors. Neutralizing experiments reveal that the biological effects exerted on PMN by TLR3-activated BM-MSC are mediated by the combined action of interleukin 6, interferon-âÃ©Â¬â¤ (IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), while those exerted by TLR4-activated BM-MSC mostly depend on GM-CSF. MSC isolated from thymus, spleen, and subcutaneous adipose tissue behaves similarly. Finally, the effects exerted by TLR3- or TLR4-stimulated BM-MSC on PMN are conserved even after the previous priming of BM-MSC with IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ and tumor necrosis factor-âÃ©Â¬Â±. Our data highlight a novel mechanism by which MSC sustain and amplify the functions of PMN in response to TLR3- and TLR4-triggering and may consequently contribute to inflammatory disorders.},

  abstract       = {Group I self-splicing introns catalyze sequential transesterification reactions within an RNA transcript to produce the correctly spliced product. Often several hundred nucleotides in size, these ribozymes fold into specific three-dimensional structures that confer activity. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a central component of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, the 160-nucleotide P4-P6 domain, provides the first detailed view of metal binding in an RNA large enough to exhibit side-by-side helical packing. The long-range contacts and bound ligands that stabilize this fold can now be examined in detail.\\ Heavy-atom derivatives used for the structure determination reveal characteristics of some of the metal-binding sites in the P4-P6 domain. Although long-range RNA-RNA contacts within the molecule primarily involve the minor groove, osmium hexammine binds at three locations in the major groove. All three sites involve G and U nucleotides exclusively; two are formed by G.U wobble base pairs. In the native RNA, two of the sites are occupied by fully-hydrated magnesium ions. Samarium binds specifically to the RNA by displacing a magnesium ion in a region critical to the folding of the entire domain.\\ Bound at specific sites in the P4-P6 domain RNA, osmium (III) hexammine produced the high-quality heavy-atom derivative used for structure determination. These sites can be engineered into other RNAs, providing a rational means of obtaining heavy-atom derivatives with hexammine compounds. The features of the observed metal-binding sites expand the known repertoire of ligand-binding motifs in RNA, and suggest that some of the conserved tandem G.U base pairs in ribosomal RNAs are magnesium-binding sites.},

The HeLa human cervical cancer cell line was used in the present study, and cell apoptosis was determined following poly (I:C) transfection. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of interferon (IFN)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, mitochondrial membrane potential (âÂ¢ÃÃâÃâ âÃ©Â¬Â®m) and the release of cytochrome c, as well as caspase activation, were determined. The effect of IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤ on poly (I:C) transfectionâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²mediated apoptosis was also examined by IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤ knockdown. The results showed that poly (I:C) transfection markedly induced HeLa apoptosis, increased the protein levels of proâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²apoptotic B cell lymphomaâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²2 (BclâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²2)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²associated X protein (Bax) and BH3 interactingâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²domain death agonist (Bid), and suppressed the protein expression levels of antiâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²apoptotic BclâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²2 and Survivin. However, poly (I:C) transfection increased the mRNA levels of IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤, induced ROS production and increased the levels of phosphorylated âÃ©Â¬â¥H2A.X, an indicator of DNA damage. In addition, poly (I:C) transfection decreased âÂ¢ÃÃâÃâ âÃ©Â¬Â®m, triggered the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and induced caspaseâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²9 and âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²3 activation. IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤ knockdown decreased the poly (I:C)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²induced production of ROS and DNA damage, restored âÂ¢ÃÃâÃâ âÃ©Â¬Â®m and cytochrome c release, and suppressed caspaseâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²9 and âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²3 activation, thereby suppressing poly (I:C)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²mediated apoptosis in the HeLa cells. Together, the results of the present study demonstrated that poly (I:C) transfection induced IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤, contributing to ROS production, DNA damage, and caspaseâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²9 and âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²3 activation in the HeLa cervical cancer cell line, leading to mitochondrialâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²mediated apoptosis.},

  abstract       = {Dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) perform a number of functions in different immunological settings. In standard in vitro experiments, DCs are produced from mouse bone marrow (BM) cells in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4. Our previous study demonstrated that BM precursor cells could differentiate into MDSCs when co-cultured with poly (I:C). In the present study, BM precursor cells cultured in GM-CSF and IL-4 were treated with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN). We observed that Gr1+CD11b+ cells exhibiting MDSC functions accumulated in the co-culture system. A similar phenomenon was also observed in Listeria monocytogenes-infected mice. In conclusion, we demonstrated that prolonged CpG ODN stimulation could inhibit the development of DCs and induce the differentiation of BM precursor cells into MDSCs.},

  abstract       = {The full-length cDNA coding for a novel invertebrate (i-type) lysozyme was identified in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The newly obtained L. vannamei lysozyme is similar to the Penaeus monodon i-type lysozyme 2, but it is distant from the known L. vannamei c-type lysozyme and i-type lysozyme 1 in protein sequence; therefore, it was defined as L. vannamei i-type lysozyme 2 (lyz-i2). Expression of L. vannamei lyz-i2 transcripts were ubiquitously detected in all tissues we selected, with the highest abundance observed in the hemolymph. Challenge with Vibrio harveyi might elicit L. vannamei lyz-i2 mRNA expression in the hepatopancreas, intestine, muscle, gill and hemolymph. In the themolymph, specifically, the stimulatory effects of Vibrio and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on lyz-i2 transcript levels were durable and transient, respectively; while Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] treatment did not affect lyz-i2 expression. L. vannamei lyz-i2 recombinant protein was generated in an Escherichia coli system. By lysoplate and turbidimetric assays, the L. vannamei lyz-i2 recombinant protein showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties with high activities against Micrococcaceae lysodeikticus and various Vibrio species and relatively low activity against E. coli. In conclusion, L. vannamei lyz-i2 might be a potent antibacterial protein with a role in innate immunity in Penaeid shrimp.},

The increased myelopoiesis was reflected by an increase in bone marrow cellularity and granulocyte-M phi colony-forming cells (GM-CFU-C). The increase in myelopoiesis appeared to be related to a concomitant increase in colony-stimulated factor (CSF) production and secretion by M phi and bone marrow cells. CSF induction by BRMs increased myelopoiesis and counteracted the myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive effects of cyclophosphamide. CSF induced in vivo by BRMs attained high titers and were maintained over a longer period than exogenously injected CSF, which was rapidly cleared from serum.},

  abstract       = {As biochemists, one of our most captivating teaching 	tools is the use of molecular visualization. It is a compelling 	medium that can be used to communicate structural information much 	more effectively with interactive animations than with static 	figures. We have conducted a survey to begin a systematic evaluation 	of the current classroom usage of molecular visualization. 	Participants (n = 116) were asked to complete 11 multiple choice and 	3 open ended questions. To provide more depth to these results, 	interviews were conducted with 12 of the participants. Many common 	themes arose in the survey and the interviews: a shared passion for 	the use of molecular visualization in teaching, broad diversity in 	software preference, the lack of uniform standards for assessment, a 	desire for more quality resources, and the challenge of enabling 	students to incorporate visualization in their learning. The 	majority of respondents had used molecular visualization for more 	than 5 years and mentioned 32 different visualization tools used, 	with Jmol and PyMOL clearly standing out as the most frequently used 	programs at the present time. The most common uses of molecular 	visualization in teaching were lecture and lab illustrations, 	followed by exam questions, in-class or in-laboratory exercises, and 	student projects, which frequently included presentations. While a 	minority of instructors used a grading rubric/scoring matrix for 	assessment of student learning with molecular visualization, many 	expressed a desire for common use assessment tools.},

  abstract       = {We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to evaluate the solution structure of a double-stranded RNA with 32 base pairs. We wanted to compare the solution structure to the crystal structure to assess the impact of the crystal lattice on the overall conformation of the RNA. The RNA was designed to self-anneal and form a head-to-head fusion of two identical mRNA/oligo(U) tail domains (the U-helix) from a trypanosome RNA editing substrate formed by the annealing of a guide RNA to a pre-edited mRNA. This substrate is from the U insertion/deletion RNA editing system of trypanosomes. Each strand in the fusion RNA had 16 purines from the pre-mRNA followed by 16 uracils (Us) from the U-tail at the 3' end of the guide RNA. The strands were designed to form a double helix with blunt ends, but each strand had the potential to form hairpins and single-stranded RNA helices. Hairpins could form by the 3' oligouridylate tract folding back to hybridize with the 5' oligopurine tract and forming an intervening loop. Single-stranded helices could form by the stacking of bases in the polypurine tract. Some of the 16 Us 3' to the polypurine tract may have been unstacked and in random coils. Our SAXS studies showed that the RNA formed a mix of single-stranded structures in the absence of MgCl2. In the presence of MgCl2 at concentrations similar to those in the crystal, the solution structure was consistent with the double-stranded, blunt-ended structure, in agreement with the crystal structure. Here we describe the preparation of RNA samples, data collection with an in-house SAXS instrument designed for biological samples, and the processing and modeling of the scattering data.},

  abstract       = {A functionally responsive natural killer (NK)-cell repertoire requires the acquisition of inhibitory NKG2A and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) through pathways that remain undefined. Functional donor NK cells expressing KIRs for non-self class I MHC ligands contribute to a positive outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) by targeting HLA-matched recipient leukemic cells. Insofar as circulating donor conventional dendritic cells (DC) reconstitute with comparable kinetics with donor NK cells after alloHSCT, we used hyporesponsive KIRnegNKG2Aneg precursor cells to evaluate how specific DC subtypes generate a functionally active NK-cell repertoire. Both monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) and Langerhans-type DCs (LC) induce KIRnegNKG2Aneg precursor cells to express the inhibitory receptors NKG2A and KIR, without requiring cell proliferation. Poly(I:C)-matured moDCs significantly augmented the expression of NKG2A, but not KIR, in an IL12p70-dependent manner. Although all DC-stimulated KIRnegNKG2Aneg cells were able to acquire cytolytic activity against class I MHC-negative targets, the ability to secrete IFNâÃ©Â¬â¥ was restricted to cells that were stimulated by IL12p70-producing, poly(I:C)-matured moDCs. This critical ability of poly(I:C)-matured moDCs to provide IL12p70 to developing KIRnegNKG2Aneg precursors results in a dom4inant, multifunctional, NKG2Apos NK-cell population that is capable of both cytolysis and IFNâÃ©Â¬â¥ production. Poly(I:C)-matured moDCs are, therefore, the most effective conventional DC subtype for generating a functionally competent NK-cell repertoire by an IL12p70-dependent mechanism.},

Included were the tetraloops GNRA and UNCG (where N is any nucleotide and R is a purine), hexaloops with UU first mismatches, and the hairpin loop of the iron responsive element, CAGUGC. The experimental values for the GNRA loops are in excellent agreement (deltaG degrees 37 within 0.2 kcal/mol and melting temperature (TM) within 4 degrees C) with the values predicted by the model. When the UNCG hairpin loops are treated as tetraloops, and a bonus of 0.8 kcal/mol included in the prediction to account for the extra stable first mismatch (UG), the measured and predicted values are also in good agreement (deltaG degrees 37 within 0.7 kcal/mol and TM within 3 degrees C). Six hairpins with unusually stable UU first mismatches also gave good agreement with the predictions (deltaG degrees 37 within 0.5 kcal/mol and TM within 8 degrees C), except for hairpins closed by wobble base pairs. For these hairpins, exclusion of the additional stabilization term for UU first mismatches improved the prediction (AG degrees 37 within 0.1 kcal/mol and TM within 3 degrees C). Hairpins with the iron-responsive element loop were not predicted well by the model, as measured deltaG degrees 37 values were at least 1 kcal/mol greater than predicted.},

  abstract       = {MolProbity is a general-purpose web server offering quality validation for 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids and complexes. It provides detailed all-atom contact analysis of any steric problems within the molecules as well as updated dihedral-angle diagnostics, and it can calculate and display the H-bond and van der Waals contacts in the interfaces between components. An integral step in the process is the addition and full optimization of all hydrogen atoms, both polar and nonpolar. New analysis functions have been added for RNA, for interfaces, and for NMR ensembles. Additionally, both the web site and major component programs have been rewritten to improve speed, convenience, clarity and integration with other resources. MolProbity results are reported in multiple forms: as overall numeric scores, as lists or charts of local problems, as downloadable PDB and graphics files, and most notably as informative, manipulable 3D kinemage graphics shown online in the KiNG viewer. This service is available free to all users at http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu.},

  abstract       = {Bcl-XL binds to Bax, inhibiting Bax oligomerization required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) during apoptosis. How Bcl-XL binds to Bax in the membrane is not known. Here, we investigated the structural organization of Bcl-XLÂ¬âBax complexes formed in the MOM, including the binding interface and membrane topology, using site-specific cross-linking, compartment-specific labeling, and computational modeling. We found that one heterodimer interface is formed by a specific interaction between the Bcl-2 homology 1-3 (BH1-3) groove of Bcl-XL and the BH3 helix of Bax, as defined previously by the crystal structure of a truncated Bcl-XL protein and a Bax BH3 peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 3PL7). We also discovered a novel interface in the heterodimer formed by equivalent interactions between the helix 1 regions of Bcl-XL and Bax when their helical axes are oriented either in parallel or antiparallel. The two interfaces are located on the cytosolic side of the MOM, whereas helix 9 of Bcl-XL is embedded in the membrane together with helices 5, 6, and 9 of Bax. Formation of the helix 1Â¬âhelix 1 interface partially depends on the formation of the grooveÂ¬âBH3 interface because point mutations in the latter interface and the addition of ABT-737, a groove-binding BH3 mimetic, blocked the formation of both interfaces. The mutations and ABT-737 also prevented Bcl-XL from inhibiting Bax oligomerization and subsequent MOMP, suggesting that the structural organization in which interactions at both interfaces contribute to the overall stability and functionality of the complex represents antiapoptotic Bcl-XLÂ¬âBax complexes in the MOM.},

  abstract       = {Continuum solvation models, such as Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized Born methods, have become increasingly popular tools for investigating the influence of electrostatics on biomolecular structure, energetics and dynamics. However, the use of such methods requires accurate and complete structural data as well as force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii. Unfortunately, the limiting step in continuum electrostatics calculations is often the addition of missing atomic coordinates to molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and the assignment of parameters to biomolecular structures. To address this problem, we have developed the PDB2PQR web service (http://agave.wustl.edu/pdb2pqr/). This server automates many of the common tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, including adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures, estimating titration states and protonating biomolecules in a manner consistent with favorable hydrogen bonding, assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally generating 'PQR' output compatible with several popular computational biology packages. This service is intended to facilitate the setup and execution of electrostatics calculations for both experts and non-experts and thereby broaden the accessibility to the biological community of continuum electrostatics analyses of biomolecular systems.},

  abstract       = {Drawing from the growing database of complex three-dimensional RNA structures, a systematic method has been developed for classifying and analyzing the variety of conformations adopted by nucleic acids. This method is based on the development of a reduced representation for nucleic acid backbone conformation, simplifying the formidable eight-dimensional problem that has long complicated nucleic acid conformational analysis. Two pseudotorsion angles (eta and theta) have been defined, based on the selection of two appropriate pivot points along the RNA backbone, P and C4'. These pseudotorsions, together with a complete library of conventional torsion angles, can be calculated for any RNA structure or all-atom model using a new program called AMIGOS. Having computed eta and theta pseudotorsions for each position on an RNA molecule, they can be represented on a two-dimensional plot similar to the phi-phi plots that have traditionally been used for protein conformational analysis. Like a Ramachandran plot, clusters of residues appear at discrete regions on an eta-theta plot. Nucleotides within these clusters share conformational properties, of ten belonging to the same type of structural motif such as A-platforms, sheared tandem purine-purine pairs and GNRA tetraloops. An eta-theta plot provides a two-dimensional representation of the conformational properties of an entire RNA molecule, facilitating rapid analysis of structural features. Ln addition to the utility of eta-theta plots for intuitive visualization of conformational space, the pseudotorsional convention described here should significantly simplify approaches to macromolecular modeling of RNA structure.

The HMT-adduct of d(CCGCTAGCGG) forms a psoralen-induced Holliday junction, showing for the first time the effect of this important class of chemotheraputics on the structure of the recombination intermediate. In contrast, HMT-d(CCGGTACCGG) forms a sequence-dependent junction. In both structures, the DNA duplex is highly distorted at the thymine base linked to the six-member pyrone ring of the drug. The psoralen cross-link defines the intramolecular interactions of the drug-induced junction, while the sequence-dependent structure is nearly identical to the native Holliday junction of d(CCGGTACCGG) alone. The two structures contrast the effects of drug- and sequence-dependent interactions on the structure of a Holliday junction, suggesting a role for psoralen in the mechanism to initiate repair of psoralen-lesions in mammalian DNA.},

  abstract       = {Holliday junctions are important structural intermediates in recombination, viral integration, and DNA repair. We present here the single-crystal structure of the inverted repeat sequence d(CCGGTACCGG) as a Holliday junction at the nominal resolution of 2. 1 A. Unlike the previous crystal structures, this DNA junction has B-DNA arms with all standard Watson-Crick base pairs; it therefore represents the intermediate proposed by Holliday as being involved in homologous recombination. The junction is in the stacked-X conformation, with two interconnected duplexes formed by coaxially stacked arms, and is crossed at an angle of 41.4 degrees as a right-handed X. A sequence comparison with previous B-DNA and junction crystal structures shows that an ACC trinucleotide forms the core of a stable junction in this system. The 3'-C x G base pair of this ACC core forms direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the phosphates at the crossover strands. Interactions within this core define the conformation of the Holliday junction, including the angle relating the stacked duplexes and how the base pairs are stacked in the stable form of the junction.},

  abstract       = {The various physical factors affecting measured diffraction intensities are discussed, as are the scaling models which may be used to put the data on a consistent scale. After scaling, the intensities can be analysed to set the real resolution of the data set, to detect bad regions (e.g. bad images), to analyse radiation damage and to assess the overall quality of the data set. The significance of any anomalous signal may be assessed by probability and correlation analysis. The algorithms used by the CCP4 scaling program SCALA are described. A requirement for the scaling and merging of intensities is knowledge of the Laue group and point-group symmetries: the possible symmetry of the diffraction pattern may be determined from scores such as correlation coefficients between observations which might be symmetry-related. These scoring functions are implemented in a new program POINTLESS.},

We have identified the COIII transcript in the T. brucei mitochondrion by RNA and cDNA sequencing. Its nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are very similar to those from the COIII genes in related species. A mitochondrial DNA sequence that matches the COIII transcript, except for the absence of numerous thymidines, is located upstream of the apocytochrome b gene, the position of the COIII gene in related species. We conclude that this sequence is the COIII gene and that over 50% of the T. brucei COIII transcript sequence is created by RNA editing.},

  abstract       = {Features of the land management history over a 125,755 km(2) area of central Queensland, Australia were determined from a variety of sources. A random sample of 205 site locations provided the basis for determining trends in land use. Trends in vegetation clearing were determined using sequential aerial photography for the sample sites, revealing a steady rate averaging nearly 1% of the region per annum over 41 years. This measure of sustained clearing over a large region is higher than recently published clearing rates from South America. Land types have been selectively cleared with over 90% of the Acacia on clay land type having been cleared. A land-holder questionnaire pertaining to the random sites yielded a response rate of 71% and provided information on vegetation clearing, ploughing, tree killing (ring-barking or tree poisoning), and fire frequency, season and intensity. The land-holder responses were compared with independent data sources where possible and revealed no mis-information. However, land-holders may have been marginally less likely to respond if the sample area had been cleared, although this effect was not statistically significant. Ploughing and tree killing are variable depending on land type, but the former has affected about 40% of the Acacia on clay land type, effectively eliminating options for natural regrowth. The proportion of decade-site combinations that were reported as having no fires increased from 22% in the 1950s to an average of 42% for subsequent decades, although the reporting of more than one fire per decade has been relatively constant through the study period. The reporting of at least one fire per decade varies from 46% for the Acacia on sand land type to 77% for the Eucalypt on sand land type for decade-site combinations. Fires are more intense when associated with clearing than in uncleared vegetation, but the proportion of cool and hot fires is relatively constant between land types in uncleared vegetation. Nearly all fires reported were either in spring or summer and this seasonally restricted regime is probably at variance with Aboriginal fire regimes. This study describes the rapid transformation of central Queensland. This has yielded substantially increased agricultural production but may also result in a range of negative impacts and these are discussed.},

  abstract       = {Our objectives were to identify Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human bone marrow derived adipocytes, to test specific TLR agonists for their ability to induce a proinflammatory response, and to investigate possible metabolic effects after TLR activation, in particular, those associated with insulin resistance and lipolysis. Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from human bone marrow and differentiated into adipocytes. Total RNA before or after stimulation with agonists specific for TLR was extracted for analysis of expression of TLRs proinflammatory signals and molecules involved in glucose metabolism (IRS-1 and GLUT4). Furthermore, cytokine protein expression was measured from cell lysates. Finally, insulin induced glucose uptake and lipolysis were measured. Human bone marrow-derived adipocytes express TLR1-10. They react to stimulation with specific ligands with expression of inflammatory markers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-8, MCP-1) at the RNA and protein levels. IRS-1 and GLUT4 expression was downregulated after stimulation with the TLR4 and TLR3 specific ligands LPS and poly (I:C), respectively. Insulin-induced glucose uptake was decreased and lipolysis increased. We conclude that adipocytes express TLR 1-10 and react to agonists specific for TLR 1-6. As a consequence proinflammatory cytokine are induced, in particular, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. Since stimulation is followed by decreased insulin-induced glucose uptake and increased lipolysis we conclude that TLRs may be important linking molecules in the generation of insulin resistance in fat tissue.},

  abstract       = {In order to further explore the tolerance of proteins to amino acid substitutions within the interior, a series of core residues was replaced by methionine within the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme. By replacing leucine, isoleucine, valine and phenylalanine residues a total of 10 methionines could be introduced, which corresponds to a third of the residues that are buried in this domain. As more methionines are incorporated the protein gradually loses stability. This is attributed in part to a reduction in hydrophobic stabilization, in part to the increased entropic cost of localizing the long, flexible methionine sidechains, and in part to steric clashes. The changes in structure of the mutants relative to the wildtype protein are modest but tend to increase in an additive fashion as more methionines are included. In the most extreme case, namely the 10-methionine mutant, much of the C-terminal domain remains quite similar to wildtype (root-mean-square backbone shifts of 0.56 A), while the F and G helices undergo rotations of approximately 20 degrees and center-of-mass shifts of approximately 1.4 A. For up to six methionine substitutions the changes in stability are additive. Beyond this point, however, the multiple mutants are somewhat more stable than suggested from the sum of their constituents, especially for those including the replacement Val111-->Met. This is interpreted in terms of the larger structural changes associated with this substitution. The substituted sidechains in the mutant structures have somewhat higher crystallographic thermal factors than their counterparts in WT*. Nevertheless, the interiors of the mutant proteins retain a well-defined structure with little suggestion of molten-globule characteristics. Lysozymes in which selenomethionine has been incorporated rather than methionine tend to have increased stability. At the same time they also fold faster. This provides further evidence that, at the rate-limiting step in folding, the structure of the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme is similar to that of the fully folded protein.},

  abstract       = {An increasing number of recognition mechanisms in RNA are found to involve G.U base pairs. In order to detect new functional sites of this type, we exhaustively analyzed the sequence alignments and secondary structures of eubacterial and chloroplast 16S and 23S rRNA, seeking positions with high levels of G.U pairs. Approximately 120 such sites were identified and classified according to their secondary structure and sequence environment. Overall biases in the distribution of G.U pairs are consistent with previously proposed structural rules: the side of the wobble pair that is subject to a loss of stacking is preferentially exposed to a secondary structure loop, where stacking is not as essential as in helical regions. However, multiple sites violate these rules and display highly conserved G.U pairs in orientations that could cause severe stacking problems. In addition, three motifs displaying a conserved G.U pair in a specific sequence/structure environment occur at an unusually high frequency. These motifs, of which two had not been reported before, involve sequences 5'UG3' 3'GA5' and 5'UG3' 3'GU5', as well as G.U pairs flanked by a bulge loop 3' of U. The possible structures and functions of these recurrent motifs are discussed.},

Proliferation rate was characterized by the number of CFUs in the S phase of the cell cycle. Increased proliferation of bone marrow stem cell populations was produced either by irradiating the donor mice with 3.36 Gy (336 rad) 60Co-gamma rays 7 days before the experiment or by incubating normal bone marrow cells with 10(-11) M concentration of isoproterenol. IF considerably reduced the number of CFUs in S phase in both cases without reducing the CFUs content of the samples. Injection of IF inducer (4 mg/kg poly I:C) into regenerating mice also inhibited the proliferation of CFUs without decreasing the femoral CFUs level. Regeneration kinetics of CFUs from irradiated poly I:C-treated mice ran parallel with that of irradiated untreated animals but showed a characteristic delay corresponding to approximately one CFUs doubling. A transient, non-cytotoxic proliferation inhibitory effect of IF or IF inducer is, therefore, proposed.},

  abstract       = {Thermodynamic parameters are reported for hairpin formation in 1 M NaCl by RNA sequences of the type GGXANmAYCC, where XY is the wobble base pair, GU or UG, and the underlined loop sequences are three to eight nucleotides. A nearest-neighbor analysis indicates the free energy of loop formation is dependent upon loop size and closing base pair. Hairpin loops closed by UG base pairs are on average 1.3 kcal/mol less stable than hairpins closed by GU base pairs. The hairpin loops closed by UG have approximately the same stability as hairpin loops closed by AU/UA base pairs, while the loops closed by GU are approximately 0.7 kcal/mol more stable than hairpins loops closed by GC/CG base pairs. These results, combined with the model previously developed [Serra et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 4844] to predict the stability for hairpin loops closed by Watson-Crick base pairs, allow for the following model to predict the stability of hairpin loops: delta G degree 37L(n) = delta G degree 37iL(n) + delta G degree 37mm + 0.6 (if closed by AU, UA, or UB) - 0.7 (if closed by GU) - 0.7 (if first mismatch is GA or UU except for loops closed by GU). Here, delta G degree 37iL(n) is the free energy increment for initiating a loop of n nucleotides with a CG or GC pair, and delta G degree 37mm is the free energy for the interaction of the first mismatch with the closing base pair. For hairpin loops of n = 4-9, delta G037iL(n) is 4.9, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.9, and 5.5 kcal/mol, respectively. For hairpin loops of n = 3, delta G degree 37L(3) = +4.8 + 0.6 (if closed by AU, UA, or UG) kcal/mol. Thermodynamic parameters for hairpin formation in 1 M NaCl for 13 naturally occurring RNA hairpin sequences closed by wobble base pairs are reported. The model provides good agreement for both TM and delta G degree 37 for most hairpins studied. Thermodynamic values for five terminal mismatches adjacent to wobble base pairs are also reported.},

  abstract       = {Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening gastrointestinal disease in premature infants with high mortality and morbidity with uncertain pathogenesis. Recent research focused on the role of intraluminal bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, an additional role of viral agents in the pathogenesis of NEC has recently been postulated. We assessed the role of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIC) mimicking viral dsRNA in contributing to the development of NEC in neonatal mice.\\ Four-d-old C57BL/6J pups were stressed by asphyxia and hypothermia twice daily. Animals were either fed by formula only (FO), formula containing LPS or pIC. After 72 h, mice were euthanized, intestines harvested, and the severity of NEC was assessed.\\ Breastfed mice showed no evidence of NEC. Very mild NEC-like lesions were observed in mice fed by FO. Supplementation of LPS or pIC to the formula led to increased intestinal tissue damage and inflammation compared with FO in a similar manner.\\ Our study demonstrates the ability of viral factors to induce NEC in neonatal mice even in the absence of LPS. Furthermore, we present a new mouse model of pIC-induced NEC which may be used to obtain further mechanistic insights in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

  abstract       = {The control of gene transcription by antigene oligonucleotides rests upon the specific recognition of double-helical DNA by triplex-forming oligonucleotides. The development of the antigene strategy requires access to the targeted DNA sequence within the chromatin structure of the cell nucleus. In this sudy we have used HIV-1 chronically infected cells containing the HIV provirus as endogenous genes to demonstrate that the integrated HIV-1 proviral genome is accessible to triplex-forming oligonucleotides within cell nuclei. An oligonucleotide-psoralen conjugate targeted to the polypurine tract (PPT) of the HIV-1 proviral sequence was used as a tool to convert the noncovalent triple-helical complex into a covalent lesion on genomic DNA after UV irradiation of cells. Triplex-derived adducts were analyzed using two different methods. The photo-induced psoralen cross-link prevented cleavage of the target sequence by DraI restriction endonuclease, and the sequence-specific inhibition of cleavage was revealed and quantitated by Southern blot analysis. A quantitative analysis of cross-linking efficiency was also carried out by a competitive PCR-based assay. These two approaches allowed us to demonstrate that a triplex-forming oligonucleotide can recognize and bind specifically to a 15-bp sequence within the chromatin structure of cell nuclei.},

  abstract       = {MicroRNAs are short (17-26) noncoding RNAs driving or modulating physiological and pathological cellular events. Overexpression of miR-155 is pathogenic in B-cell malignancy but was also reported in a number of solid tumors-in particular, in breast cancer, where its role remains unclear and often contradictory. Using representative cell line models, we sought to determine whether the discrepant miR-155 effects in breast cancer could be explained by the heterogeneity of the disease. The growth of six breast cancer cell lines transfected with several miRNA mimics was analyzed. We found MCF-7 cell growth to be inhibited by miR-155 and miR-145 mimics, both 23-nt long, but not by a number of shorter mimics, including a universal commercial negative control. Microarray and Western blot analyses revealed induction of apoptosis, associated with interferon-âÃ©Â¬â¤ after activation of the double-stranded RNA sensor pathway. 3' Trimming of the miRNA mimics to 21 nt substantially reduced their growth-inhibitory potency. Mutating the canonical seed of the miR-155 mimic had no effect on the induced inhibition, which was abolished by mutating the miRNA seed of the artificial passenger strand. A panel of breast cancer cell lines showed a wide range of sensitivities to 23-mer mimics, broadly consistent with the sensitivity of the cell lines to Poly (I:C). We demonstrate two sources for nonspecific in vitro effects by miRNA mimics: duplex length and the artificial passenger strand. We highlight the danger of a universal 21-mer negative control and the importance of using matched seed mutants for reliable interpretation of phenotypes.},

  abstract       = {Synthetic double stranded RNA (Poly(I:C)) injection of Crassostrea gigas results in a systemic antiviral response involving many evolutionary conserved antiviral effectors (ISGs). Compared to mammals, the timing of C. gigas ISG expression to viral or poly(I:C) injection is delayed (>12 h p.i.). It could be interpreted that a cytokine is responsible for the systemic, but delayed expression of C. gigas ISGs. We therefore analysed the acellular fraction of C. gigas hemolymph by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) to identify hemolymph proteins induced by poly(I:C). Poly(I:C) injection increased the relative intensity of four protein spots. These protein spots were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as a small heat shock protein (sHSP), poly(I:C)-inducible protein 1 (PIP1) and two isoforms of C1q-domain containing protein (C1qDC). RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that the genes encoding these proteins are induced in hemocytes of C. gigas injected with poly(I:C) (p < 0.05). Proteomic data from this experiment corroborates previous microarray and whole transcriptome studies that have reported up-regulation of C1qDC and sHSP during mass mortality events among farmed oysters.},

  abstract       = {Many viral proteins exhibit selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells without affecting the normal diploid cells. The apoptin protein of chicken infectious anemia virus is one of such proteins, which has been shown to kill tumor cells specifically. However, an effective cancer treatment strategy also requires assistance from the immune system. Recently, poly (I:C) has been shown to be an effective cancer vaccine adjuvant.\\ In this study, we assessed the anti-tumor potential of apoptin gene transfer alone and in combination with poly (I:C) in a 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model.\\ 4T1 cells were used to induce mammary tumor in Balb/c mice. Mice bearing tumors were divided into 6 groups, and each group received six intratumoral injections during a period of one month. After the last immunization, the animals were sacrificed, and peripheral blood, spleen, lungs, liver, heart, kidney and tumor tissues were collected for immunological, molecular and pathological analysis.\\ We report that intratumoral administration of apoptin plasmid along with poly (I:C) not only significantly inhibited the growth of mammary tumor, but also induced a potent anti-tumor immune response as indicated by the increase in blood CD4+, CD8+ cells and infiltration of immune cells in the tumor tissue. Further, blood serum analysis of the cytokines revealed increased secretion of Th1 cytokines (IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ and IL-2).\\ The results of our study demonstrate that the inclusion of poly (I:C) significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of apoptin mainly by inducing a potent anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, we report the use of apoptin and poly (I:C) combination as a novel and powerful strategy for cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract       = {The canine parvovirus NS1 (CPV2.NS1) protein selectively induces apoptosis in the malignant cells. However, for an effective in vivo tumor treatment strategy, an oncolytic agent also needs to induce a potent anti-tumor immune response. In the present study, we used poly (I:C), a TLR3 ligand, as an adjuvant along with CPV2.NS1 to find out if the combination can enhance the oncolytic activity by inducing a potent anti-tumor immune response. The 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells were used to induce mammary tumor in Balb/c mice. The results suggested that poly (I:C), when given along with CPV2.NS1, not only significantly reduced the tumor growth but also augmented the immune response against tumor antigen(s) as indicated by the increase in blood CD4+ and CD8+ counts and infiltration of immune cells in the tumor tissue. Further, blood serum analysis of the cytokines revealed that Th1 cytokines (IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ and IL-2) were significantly upregulated in the treatment group indicating activation of cell-mediated immune response. The present study reports the efficacy of CPV2.NS1 along with poly (I:C) not only in inhibiting the mammary tumor growth but also in generating an active anti-tumor immune response without any visible toxicity. The results of our study may help in developing CPV2.NS1 and poly (I: C) combination as a cancer therapeutic regime to treat various malignancies.},

  abstract       = {In 1985 an analysis of the Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA covariation-based structure model revealed a strong bias for unpaired adenosines. The same analysis revealed that the majority of the G, C, and U bases were paired. These biases are (now) consistent with the high percentage of unpaired adenosine nucleotides in several structure motifs. An analysis of a larger set of bacterial comparative 16 S and 23 S rRNA structure models has substantiated this initial finding and revealed new biases in the distribution of adenosine nucleotides in loop regions. The majority of the adenosine nucleotides are unpaired, while the majority of the G, C, and U bases are paired in the covariation-based structure model. The unpaired adenosine nucleotides predominate in the middle and at the 3' end of loops, and are the second most frequent nucleotide type at the 5' end of loops (G is the most common nucleotide). There are additional biases for unpaired adenosine nucleotides at the 3' end of loops and adjacent to a G at the 5' end of the helix. The most prevalent consecutive nucleotides are GG, GA, AG, and AA. A total of 70 % of the GG sequences are within helices, while more than 70 % of the AA sequences are unpaired. Nearly 50 % of the GA sequences are unpaired, and approximately one-third of the AG sequences are within helices while another third are at the 3' loop.5' helix junction. Unpaired positions with an adenosine nucleotide in more than 50 % of the sequences at the 3' end of 16 S and 23 S rRNA loops were identified and arranged into the A-motif categories XAZ, AAZ, XAG, AAG, and AAG:U, where G or Z is paired, G:U is a base-pair, and X is not an A and Z is not a G in more than 50 % of the sequences. These sequence motifs were associated with several structural motifs, such as adenosine platforms, E and E-like loops, A:A and A:G pairings at the end of helices, G:A tandem base-pairs, GNRA tetraloop hairpins, and U-turns.},

  abstract       = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as endogenous small non-coding RNAs play key regulatory roles in diverse biological processes via degrading the target mRNAs or inhibiting protein translation. Previously many researchers have reported the identification, characteristic of miRNAs and the interaction with its target gene. But, the study on the regulation of miRNAs to biological processes via regulatory the key signaling pathway was still limited. In order to comprehend the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs, two small RNA libraries from the spleen of miiuy croaker individuals with or without poly(I:C) infection were constructed. The 197 conserved miRNAs and 75 novel miRNAs were identified, and 14 conserved and 8 novel miRNAs appeared significant variations. Those differently expressed miRNAs relate to immune regulation of miiuy croaker. Furthermore, expressions of four differently expressed miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the result was consistent with sequencing data. The target genes of the differently expressed miRNAs in the two libraries were predicted, and some candidate target genes were involved in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. The negative regulation of miRNAs to target genes were confirmed by comparing the expression pattern of miRNAs and their target genes. The results of regulating target genes were that firstly directly or indirectly activating the downstream signaling cascades and subsequent inducting the type I interferon, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. These studies could help us to deeper understand the roles of miRNAs played in the fish immune system, and provide a new way to investigate the defense mechanism of fish.},

By their nature, movies or animations 	are particularly useful for highlighting key features by offering a 	'guided tour' of structures and conformation changes. However, 	high-quality movies are rarely seen because they are currently 	difficult and time consuming to make. By adopting the traditional 	movie 'storyboard' concept, which gives guidance and direction to 	filming, eMovie makes the creation of lengthy molecular animations 	much easier. This tool is a plug-in for the open-source molecular 	graphics program PyMOL, and enables experts and novices alike to 	produce informative and high-quality molecular animations.},

  abstract       = {Tetraspanins are a group of cell surface molecules involved in cell adhesion, motility, metastasis, signal transduction, and immune cell activation. Members of the tetraspanin family include CD9, CD37, CD63, CD53, and others. However, few tetraspanins have been investigated in teleosts. In this study, we obtained the open reading frame of CD53 cDNA from orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioices), an economically important fish. The predicted amino acid structure contains four membrane-spanning domains and a conserved CCG motif. The amino acid identity between human and grouper CD53 was only 38%; however, both CD53 proteins share the same structure. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that mRNA is abundant in immune organs, including the head and trunk kidneys, spleen, thymus, gill, and blood. Immunochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses further revealed that CD53 was majorly expressed in the leukocytes of various organs. Finally, mRNA and protein expression for CD53 was down-regulated in fish treated with immune stimulators, including LPS, Poly (I:C), Vibrio, recombinant grouper IL-6, and CCL4. Our results indicate that the expression of CD53 may play important roles in pathogen invasion and inflammation reaction.},

  abstract       = {The RNP domain is a very common motif found in hundreds of proteins, including many protein components of the RNA processing machinery. The 70-90 amino acid domain contains two highly conserved stretches of 6-8 amino acids (RNP-1 and RNP-2) in the central strands of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, packed against two alpha-helices by a conserved hydrophobic core. Using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR, we have mapped intermolecular contacts between the human U1A protein 102 amino acid N-terminal RNP domain and a 31-mer oligonucleotide derived from stem-loop II of U1 snRNA. Chemical shift changes induced on the protein by the RNA define the surface of the beta-sheet as the recognition interface. The reverse face of the protein, with the two alpha-helices, remains exposed to the solvent in the presence of the RNA, and is potentially available for protein-protein contacts in spliceosome assembly or splice site selection. Protein-RNA contacts occur at the single-stranded apical loop of the hairpin, but also in the major groove of the helical stem at neighbouring U.G and U.U non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Examination of a proposed model for the complex in the light of the present results reveals several features of RNA recognition by RNP proteins. The quality of the spectra for this complex of 22 kDa demonstrates the feasibility of NMR investigation of RNA-protein complexes.},

  abstract       = {Germ cell apoptosis may be associated with the male infertility. The pathogenesis is to be further understood. Viral infection is one of the causative factors of apoptosis of the body cells. This study aims to investigate the role of activation of Toll like receptor (TLR)3 in the induction of germ cell apoptosis. In this study, spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) were isolated from C57BL/6 mouse testes. The expression of TLR3 on SSC was by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) was employed to activate TLR3 on SSCs. The results showed that re-activation by PolyI:C induced SSC apoptosis. Exposure to PolyI:C induced interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation in SSCs. TLR3 and IRF3 formed a complex in the SSCs. The complex of TLR3/IRF3 bound to the promoter of Fas ligand and promoted Fas ligand expression in SSC, and thus induced SSC apoptosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that activation of TLR3 by PolyI:C induces the SSC apoptosis, which implies that viral infection may interfere with the male germ cell development.},

  abstract       = {The protein kinase R (PKR) can inhibit protein translation and lead to apoptosis under the circumstances of virus invasion and multiple other stress conditions. PKR is a dsRNA binding protein with a dsRBD and a kinase domain (KD). dsRBD is mostly composed of two (in mammal PKR) or three (in some fish PKR) dsRNA binding motifs (dsRBMs). Multiple sequences alignment and Phylogenetic analysis indicate that the three dsRBMs of fish PKR share analogous structure but show to be divergence origination. In this study, we have identified and analyzed the three dsRBMs from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) PKR (CiPKR), which was cloned previously in our laboratory. dsRBMs of CiPKR have two or three conserved regions involved in dsRNA binding. Among the three dsRBMs, dsRBM1 was peculiar to some fish PKRs, while dsRBM2 and dsRBM3 were closely related to the dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 of mammal PKRs respectively. Dimerization assay indicated that dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 formed not only homo-dimer but also homo-multimer; whereas dsRBM3 formed merely homo-dimer. Meanwhile, dsRBM1-2, dsRBM2-3 and dsRBM1-2-3 could homo-dimerize and homo-multimerize also. Poly I:C pull-down assay showed that the binding of dsRBM to Poly I:C needed two or three dsRBMs to cooperate in vitro, meaning one dsRBM from CiPKR could not bind to dsRNA efficiently. To further investigate the effect of dsRBM on the function of CiPKR, we constructed pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-wt and a series of CiPKR mutants recombined plasmids including pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM2-3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1,3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1-2, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1. The recombined plasmids respectively were co-transfected with plasmid PGL3 promoter into CIK cells. In comparison with the control group, the luciferase translation inhibitions were 78.7%, 15%, 0, 0.5%, 61.8%, 67.3% respectively. The results indicated that the protein translation inhibition caused by CiPKR mutants with only one dsRBM were very weak, while those with two or three dsRBMs inhibited the protein translation powerfully. Cell viability were 34.2%, 98.2%, 112%, 108%, 50.3%, 47.5% respectively after transfected with pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-wt, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM2-3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1,3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1-2, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1 in order into CIK cells for 48 h. The results from cell counting also indicated that transfection of CiPKR-wt and the mutants CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM3, CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1 could inhibit the protein translation and facilitated the decrease of CIK cells number. In conclusion, our observations suggested that two dsRBMs ranking in tandem at N terminal were essential for the function of CiPKR, and the presence of the extra dsRBM1 enhanced its function.},

  abstract       = {Protein-based vaccine is promising to improve or replace Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine for its specificity, safety, and easy production. However, protein-based vaccine calls for potent adjuvants and improved delivery systems to protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Poly(I:C) is one of the most potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns that signals primarily via TLR3. Arabinogalactan (AG) is a biocompatible polysaccharide that can increase splenocyte proliferation and stimulate macrophages. The AG-poly(I:C) conjugate (AG-P) showed an adjuvant potency through a synergistic interaction of AG and poly(I:C). Ag85B and HspX are two important virulent protein antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Ag85B-HspX fusion protein (AH) was prepared. An antigen-adjuvant delivery system (AH-AG-P) was developed by conjugation of AH with AG-P to ensure that both AH and AG-P reach the APCs simultaneously. AH-AG-P elicited high AH-specific IgG titers and stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. AH-AG-P provoked the secretion of Th1-type cytokines (TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â±, IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥, and IL-2) and Th2-type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). Pharmacokinetics revealed that conjugation with AG-P could prolong the serum exposure of AH to the immune system. Pharmacodynamics suggested that conjugation with AG-P led to a rapid and intense production of AH-specific IgG. Accordingly, conjugation with AG-P could promote a robust cellular and humoral immune response to AH. Thus, conjugation of AH with a potent adjuvant AG-P is an effective strategy to develop an efficacious protein-based vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.},

B6.MRL-Fas(lpr) mice were divided into UC-MSC treated group, FLS treated group, Poly(I:C) preconditioned MSC treated group (P-MSC) and untreated group randomly. All treated mice were infused with 1âÃâÃÃ®10(6) MSCs or FLSs at the 24th week and were sacrificed 4 weeks later. The spleen weight, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, serum anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels, immune cell subsets, renal lesions and IgG deposition in the kidney were evaluated. The effects of two kinds of MSCs on the proliferation and apoptosis of CD4+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry. The TLR3 expression at protein level in MSCs was assessed with and without Poly(I:C) treatment. The expression of immunoregulatory factors were detected by qRT-PCR in different dose and duration of Poly(I:C).\\ Poly(I:C) preconditioned MSCs had similar therapeutic effects in lupus mice compared with untreated MSCs in vivo. Furthermore, Poly(I:C) treated MSCs and untreated MSCs had comparable inhibitory effects on proliferation of T cells, and Poly(I:C) could enhance the expression of TLR3 at protein and mRNA level. Poly(I:C) could partly alter the mRNA levels of immunoregulatory factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor âÃ©Â¬â¤1, vascular endothelial growth factor, but did not have significant changes in cyclooxygenase 2, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor âÃ©Â¬Â±, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, interferon âÃ©Â¬â¥ and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2.\\ Our study did not find that Poly(I:C) treatment could enhance the therapeutic effect of MSCs in lupus mice in vivo.},

  abstract       = {Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising tools for such applications as tissue engineering and cellular therapy. It is not clear how stem cells exposed to unfavorable conditions (e.g., hypoxia or inflammation) respond to signals of danger after in vivo transplantation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a major role in the immune system, participating in the initial recognition of microbial pathogens and pathogen-associated components. This study was designated to determine the role of TLRs in human MSCs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that MSCs derived from human adipose tissue and bone marrow express TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6, and TLR-9. We investigated induction of the differentiation and proliferation of human adipose tissue stromal cells (hADSCs) by TLR agonists, including flagellin, peptidoglycans (PGN), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the synthetic double-stranded RNA analog poly(I:C), and synthetic CpG oligodeoxydinucleotide (CpG-ODN). None of these agonists, except ODN, affected the proliferation of hADSCs. LPS and PGN increased osteogenic differentiation, but CpG-ODN decreased it. Poly(I:C) itself did not affect adipogenic or osteogenic differentiations, but exerted a synergistic effect on LPS- or PGN-induced osteogenic differentiation. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that LPS and PGN induce osteogenic markers in hADSCs. TLR agonists affected the expression of chemokines and cytokines differentially. Furthermore, hADSCs affected the expression of specific TLRs in vitro under hypoxic conditions. These data provide evidence of a nonimmune role for TLR signaling on MSCs and may provide clues to the behavior of transplanted MSCs in vivo.},

  abstract       = {In the absence of base-pairing and tertiary structure, ribonucleic acid (RNA) assumes a random-walk conformation, modulated by the electrostatic self-repulsion of the charged, flexible backbone. This behavior is often modeled as a Kratky-Porod "wormlike chain" (WLC) with a Barrat-Joanny scale-dependent persistence length. In this study we report measurements of the end-to-end extension of poly(U) RNA under 0.1 to 10 pN applied force and observe two distinct elastic-response regimes: a low-force, power-law regime characteristic of a chain of swollen blobs on long length scales and a high-force, salt-valence-dependent regime consistent with ion-stabilized crumpling on short length scales. This short-scale structure is additionally supported by force- and salt-dependent quantification of the RNA ion atmosphere composition, which shows that ions are liberated under stretching; the number of ions liberated increases with increasing bulk salt concentration. Both this result and the observation of two elastic-response regimes directly contradict the WLC model, which predicts a single elastic regime across all forces and, when accounting for scale-dependent persistence length, the opposite trend in ion release with salt concentration. We conclude that RNA is better described as a "snakelike chain," characterized by smooth bending on long length scales and ion-stabilized crumpling on short length scales. In monovalent salt, these two regimes are separated by a characteristic length that scales with the Debye screening length, highlighting the determining importance of electrostatics in RNA conformation.},

  abstract       = {Two classes of nucleic acids, bacterial DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs and dsRNA in viruses, induce the production of type I IFN that contributes to the immunostimulatory effects of these microbial molecules. Thus, it is important to determine which cells produce type I IFN in response to CpG DNA and dsRNA. CD4(+)CD11c(-) type 2 dendritic cell precursors (pre-DC2) were identified as the main producers of type I IFN in human blood in response to viruses. Here we asked whether pre-DC2 also produce type I IFN in response to CpG DNA and dsRNA. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing particular palindromic CpG motifs induced pre-DC2, but not CD11c(+) blood DC or monocytes, to produce IFN-alpha. In contrast, a synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic polycytidylic-acid, induced CD11c(+) DC, but not pre-DC2 or monocytes, to produce IFN-alphabeta. These data indicate that CpG DNA and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stimulate different types of cells to produce type I IFN and that it is important to select oligodeoxynucleotides containing particular CpG motifs to induce pre-DC2 to produce type I IFN, which may play a key role in the strong adjuvant effects of CpG DNA.},

  abstract       = {Therapeutic cancer vaccines are designed to treat cancer by boosting the endogenous immune system to fight against the cancer. In the development of clinically effective cancer vaccines, one of the most practical objectives is to identify adjuvants that are capable of optimizing the vaccine effects. In this study, we explored the potential of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and LAG-3-Ig (soluble recombinant protein of lymphocyte activation gene-3 [LAG-3] extracellular domain fused with human IgG Fc region) as adjuvants for P1A tumor antigen peptide vaccine in a pre-established P815 mouse tumor model with a transfer of tumor-specific T cells. Whereas the use of poly(I:C) or LAG-3-Ig as a signal adjuvant induced a slight enhancement of P1A vaccine effects compared to incomplete Freund's adjuvant, combined treatment with poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig remarkably potentiated antitumor effects, leading to complete rejection of pre-established tumor and long-term survival of mice. The potent adjuvant effects of poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig were associated with an enhanced infiltration of T cells in the tumor tissues, and an increased proliferation and Th1-type cytokine production of tumor-reactive T cells. Importantly, the combined adjuvant of poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig downregulated expressions of PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT on P1A-specific T cells, indicating prevention of T cell exhaustion. Taken together, the results of the current study show that the combined adjuvants of poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig with tumor peptide vaccine induce profound antitumor effects by activating tumor-specific T cells.},

  abstract       = {Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) express functional membranous and cytoplasmic sensors for double-stranded (ds)RNA. Notably, FLS undergo apoptosis upon transfection with the synthetic dsRNA analog poly(I:C). We here studied the mechanism of intracellular poly(I:C) recognition and subsequent cell death in FLS. FLS responded similarly to poly(I:C) or 3pRNA transfection; however, only intracellular delivery of poly(I:C) induced significant cell death, accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Puma and Noxa, caspase 3 cleavage, and nuclear segregation. Knockdown of the DExD/H-box helicase MDA5 did not affect the response to intracellular poly(I:C); in contrast, knockdown of RIG-I abrogated the response to 3pRNA. Knockdown of the downstream adaptor proteins IPS, STING, and TRIF or inhibition of TBK1 did not affect the response to intracellular poly(I:C), while knockdown of IFNAR blocked intracellular poly(I:C)-mediated signaling and cell death. We conclude that a so far unknown intracellular sensor recognizes linear dsRNA and induces apoptosis in FLS.},

  abstract       = {There is an urgent need for more efficient viral vaccines in finfish aquaculture worldwide. Here, we report the use of poly(I:C) stabilized with chitosan as an adjuvant for development of better finfish vaccines. The adjuvant was co-injected with inactivated viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) (CSpIC+iV vaccine) in adult zebrafish and its efficiency in protection against VHSV infection was compared to a live, attenuated VHS virus vaccine (aV). Both free and stabilized poly(I:C) were strong inducers of an antiviral state, measured by transcriptional activation of the genes of viral sensors: toll-like receptors, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes, such as MXa within 48 h after injection. Both the CSpIC+iV and the aV formulations provided a significant protection against VHSV-induced mortality. However, when plasma from survivors was tested for neutralizing antibodies in an in vitro protection assay, we could not demonstrate any protective effect. On the contrary, plasma from aV vaccinated fish enhanced cytopathic effects, indicating that antibody-dependent entry may play a role in this system. Our results show that poly(I:C) is a promising candidate as an adjuvant for fish vaccination against viral pathogens, and that the zebrafish is a promising model for aquaculture-relevant vaccination studies.},

  abstract       = {There is a constant need to increase the efficiency of vaccines in the aquaculture industry. Although several nano-based vaccine formulations have been reported, to the best of our knowledge so far only one of them have been implemented in the industry. Here we report on chitosan-poly(I:C) nanoparticles (NPs) that could be used as a non-specific adjuvant in antiviral vaccines in aquaculture. We have characterized the physical parameters of the NPs, studied the in vivo and in vitro bio-distribution of fluorescent NPs and verified NP uptake by zebrafish leucocytes. We used the zebrafish model to test the protective efficiency of the recombinant glycoprotein G (rgpG) of VHSV compared to inactivated whole virus (iV) against VHSV using NPs as an adjuvant in both formulations. In parallel we tested free poly(I:C) and rgpG (pICrgpG), and free chitosan and rgpG (CSrgpG) vaccine formulations. While the iV group (with NP adjuvant) provided the highest overall survival, all vaccine formulations with poly(I:C) provided a significant protection against VHSV; possibly through an early induction of an anti-viral state. Our results suggest that chitosan-poly(I:C) NPs are a promising adjuvant candidate for future vaccine formulations.},

In Drosophila melanogaster, miRNAs are generally sorted into Ago1-containing RISC (Ago1-RISC). We established a native gel system that can biochemically dissect the Ago1-RISC assembly pathway. We found that miRNA-miRNA* duplexes are loaded into Ago1 as double-stranded RNAs in an ATP-dependent fashion. In contrast, unexpectedly, unwinding of miRNA-miRNA* duplexes is a passive process that does not require ATP or slicer activity of Ago1. Central mismatches direct miRNA-miRNA* duplexes into pre-Ago1-RISC, whereas mismatches in the seed or guide strand positions 12-15 promote conversion of pre-Ago1-RISC into mature Ago1-RISC. Our findings show that unwinding of miRNAs is a precise mirror-image process of target recognition, and both processes reflect the unique geometry of RNAs in Ago proteins.},

  abstract       = {Solvated metal ions are critical for the proper folding and function of RNA. Despite the importance of these ions, the details of specific metal ion-RNA interactions are poorly understood. The crystal structure of a group I intron ribozyme domain characterized several metal-binding sites in the RNA with osmium (III) hexammine bound in the major groove. A corresponding method for locating and characterizing metal-binding sites of RNA in solution is of obvious interest. NMR should be ideal for localizing metal hexammine ions bound to the RNA because of the large concentration of protons around the metal center.\\ We have solved the solution structure of the P5b stem loop from a group I intron ribozyme bound to a cobalt (III) hexammine ion. The location of the ion is precisely determined by intermolecular nuclear Overhausser effect cross-peaks between the cobalt (III) hexammine protons and both exchangeable and non-exchangeable RNA protons in the major groove. The binding site consists of tandem G-U base pairs in a sequence of four consecutive G residues ending in a GAAA tetraloop, as originally identified in the crystal structure. The edges of the bases in the major groove present an electrostatically negative face and a variety of hydrogen-bond acceptors for the cobalt (III) hexammine ion. The metal ion ligand is bound near the guanosine nucleotides of the adjacent G-U base pairs, where it makes hydrogen bonds with the N7 and carbonyl groups of both guanines. The carbonyl groups of the uracil residues add to the negative surface of the binding pocket, but do not form hydrogen bonds with the hexammine. Additional hydrogen bonds form with other guanine residues of the GGGG sequence. The structure of the binding site does not change significantly on binding the cobalt (III) hexammine. The structure of the complex in solution is very similar to the structure in the crystal.\\ The structure presents a picture of how tandem G-U base pairs bind and position metal ions within the RNA major groove. The binding site is performed in the absence of metal ions, and presents a negative pocket in the major groove with a variety of hydrogen-bond acceptors. Because G-U base pairs are such a common motif in RNA sequences, it is possible that this RNA-metal ion interaction is critical in forming large complex RNA structures such as those found in the ribosome and self-splicing introns. This structure was determined using cobalt (III) hexammine as an analog for hexahydrated magnesium, a technique that may be applicable to other RNA sequences. Metal hexammines may prove to be useful general probes for locating RNA metal ion binding sites in solution.},

  abstract       = {Respiratory viral infections cause significant morbidity and increase the risk for chronic pulmonary graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Our overall hypothesis is that local innate immune activation potentiates adaptive alloimmunity. In this study, we hypothesized that a viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) alone can potentiate pulmonary GVHD after allogeneic HCT. We, therefore, examined the effect of pulmonary exposure to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a viral mimetic that activates innate immunity, in an established murine HCT model. Poly I:C-induced a marked pulmonary T cell response in allogeneic HCT mice as compared to syngeneic HCT, with increased CD4+ cells in the lung fluid and tissue. This lymphocytic inflammation persisted at 2 weeks post poly I:C exposure in allogeneic mice and was associated with CD3+ cell infiltration into the bronchiolar epithelium and features of epithelial injury. In vitro, poly I:C enhanced allospecific proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. In vivo, poly I:C exposure was associated with an early increase in pulmonary monocyte recruitment and activation as well as a decrease in CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in allogeneic mice as compared to syngeneic. In contrast, intrapulmonary poly I:C did not alter the extent of systemic GVHD in either syngeneic or allogeneic mice. Collectively, our results suggest that local activation of pulmonary innate immunity by a viral molecular pattern represents a novel pathway that contributes to pulmonary GVHD after allogeneic HCT, through a mechanism that includes increased recruitment and maturation of intrapulmonary monocytes.},

  abstract       = {The 1.7âÃÃ¢âÃ X-ray crystal structure of the B-DNA dodecamer, [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2 (DDD)-bound non-covalently to a platinum(II) complex, [{Pt(NH3)3}2-Â¬Âµ-{trans-Pt(NH3)2(NH2(CH2)6NH2)2}](NO3)6 (1, TriplatinNC-A,) shows the trinuclear cation extended along the phosphate backbone and bridging the minor groove. The square planar tetra-am(m)ine Pt(II) units form bidentate N-O-N complexes with OP atoms, in a Phosphate Clamp motif. The geometry is conserved and the interaction prefers O2P over O1P atoms (frequency of interaction is O2PâÃÃ¢>âÃÃ¢O1P, base and sugar oxygensâÃÃ¢>âÃÃ¢N). The binding mode is very similar to that reported for the DDD and [{trans-Pt(NH3)2(NH2(CH2)6(NH3+)}2-Â¬Âµ-{trans-Pt(NH3)2(NH2(CH2)6NH2)2}](NO3)8 (3, TriplatinNC), which exhibits in vivo anti-tumour activity. In the present case, only three sets of Phosphate Clamps were found because one of the three Pt(II) coordination spheres was not clearly observed and was characterized as a bare Pt2+ ion. Based on the electron density, the relative occupancy of DDD and the sum of three Pt(II) atoms in the DDD-1 complex was 1:1.69, whereas the ratio for DDD-2 was 1:2.85, almost the mixing ratio in the crystallization drop. The high repetition and geometric regularity of the motif suggests that it can be developed as a modular nucleic acid binding device with general utility.},

  abstract       = {The most dramatic example of RNA editing is found in the mitochondria of trypanosomes. In these organisms, U-insertions/deletions can create mRNAs that are twice as large as the gene that encodes them. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) that are complementary to short stretches of the mature message direct the precise placements of the U residues. The binding of gRNA to mRNA is a fundamental step in RNA editing and understanding the relative importance of the elements that confer affinity and specificity on this interaction is critical to our understanding of the editing process. In this study, we have analyzed the relative binding affinities of two different gRNA/mRNA pairs. The affinity of gA6-14 for its message (ATPase 6) is high, with an apparent K(D) in the 5-10 nM range. In contrast, gCYb-558 has a low affinity for its cognate mRNA. Deletion of the gRNA U-tail caused a significant reduction in the binding affinity for only the gCYb-558 pair, and was observed only under physiological magnesium conditions. These results indicate that the U-tail contribution can differ substantially between the different gRNA/mRNA pairs. In addition, our results suggest that the efficiency of gRNA/mRNA interaction is highly dependent on thermodynamic parameters determined by the local sequences and their adopted structures surrounding the anchor-binding site.},

  abstract       = {Mitochondrial mRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei undergo extensive insertion and deletion of uridylates that are catalyzed by the RNA editing core complex (RECC) and directed by hundreds of small guide RNAs (gRNAs) that base pair with mRNA. RECC is largely RNA-free, and accessory mitochondrial RNA-binding complex 1 (MRB1) variants serve as scaffolds for the assembly of mRNA-gRNA hybrids and RECC. However, the molecular steps that create higher-order holoenzymes ("editosomes") are unknown. Previously, we identified an RNA editing helicase 2-associated subcomplex (REH2C) and showed that REH2 binds RNA. Here we showed that REH2C is an mRNA-associated ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) subcomplex with editing substrates, intermediates, and products. We isolated this mRNP from mitochondria lacking gRNA-bound RNP (gRNP) subcomplexes and identified REH2-associated cofactors 1 and 2 ((H2)F1 and (H2)F2). (H2)F1 is an octa-zinc finger protein required for mRNP-gRNP docking, pre-mRNA and RECC loading, and RNP formation with a short synthetic RNA duplex. REH2 and other eukaryotic DEAH/RHA-type helicases share a conserved regulatory C-terminal domain cluster that includes an oligonucleotide-binding fold. Recombinant REH2 and (H2)F1 constructs associate in a purified complex in vitro. We propose a model of stepwise editosome assembly that entails controlled docking of mRNP and gRNP modules via specific base pairing between their respective mRNA and gRNA cargo and regulatory REH2 and (H2)F1 subunits of the novel mRNP that may control specificity checkpoints in the editing pathway.},

We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on nuclear small-subunit and mitochondrial large- and small-subunit ribosomal RNA sequences for nine species of kinetoplastid protozoa. Our results suggest that extensive editing is a primitive genetic phenomenon that has disappeared in recent evolutionary time and also that there have been multiple losses of the digenetic lifestyle by loss of the vertebrate host in parasite evolution.},

  abstract       = {The immunostimulatory ability of synthetic oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG-ODN), agonists of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), can be harnessed to promote antitumor immunity by their application at the tumor site to stimulate local activation of innate immunity; however, particularly in the lung, tumor-associated immunosuppression can subvert such antitumor innate immune responses. To locally maintain continuous activation of innate subpopulations while inhibiting immunosuppressive cells, we evaluated aerosol delivery CpG-ODN combined with Poly(I:C), a TLR3 agonist able to convert tumor-supporting macrophages to tumoricidal effectors, in the treatment of B16 melanoma lung metastases in C57BL/6 mice. Aerosolization of CpG-ODN with Poly(I:C) into the bronchoalveolar space reduced the presence of M2-associated arginase- and IL-10-secreting macrophages in tumor-bearing lungs and increased the antitumor activity of aerosolized CpG-ODN alone against B16 lung metastases without apparent signs of toxicity or injury of the bronchial-bronchiolar structures and alveolar walls. Moreover, CpG-ODN/Poly(I:C) aerosol combined with dacarbazine, a therapeutic agent used in patients with inoperable metastatic melanoma able to exert immunostimulatory effects, led to a significant increase in antitumor activity as compared to treatments with aerosolized CpG-ODN/Poly(I:C) or dacarbazine alone. This effect was related to an enhanced recruitment and cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in the lung. Our results point to aerosol delivery as a convenient approach for repeated applications of immunostimulants in patients with lung metastases to maintain a continuous local activation of innate immune cells while suppressing polarization of tumor-infiltrating macrophages to an M2 phenotype.},

  abstract       = {The success of molecular replacement is critically dependent on the quality of the search model. Several model-preparation procedures are integrated in the molecular-replacement program MOLREP. These include model modification on the basis of amino-acid sequence alignment and model correction based on analysis of the solvent-accessibility of the atoms. The packing function used in MOLREP for the translational search is explained in the context of model preparation. In difficult cases, bioinformatics-based modifications are not sufficient for successful molecular replacement. An approach implemented in MOLREP for solving cases with translational noncrystallographic symmetry is an example of model preparation in which analysis of X-ray data plays an essential role. In addition, two examples are presented in which the X-ray data were used to refine partial models for subsequent use in molecular replacement.},

  abstract       = {Helices are an essential element in defining the three-dimensional architecture of structured RNAs. While internal basepairs in a canonical helix stack on both sides, the ends of the helix stack on only one side and are exposed to the loop side, thus susceptible to fraying unless they are protected. While coaxial stacking has long been known to stabilize helix ends by directly stacking two canonical helices coaxially, based on analysis of helix-loop junctions in RNA crystal structures, herein we describe helix capping, topological stacking of a helix end with a basepair or an unpaired nucleotide from the loop side, which in turn protects helix ends. Beyond the topological protection of helix ends against fraying, helix capping should confer greater stability onto the resulting composite helices. Our analysis also reveals that this general motif is associated with the formation of tertiary structure interactions. Greater knowledge about the dynamics at the helix-junctions in the secondary structure should enhance the prediction of RNA secondary structure with a richer set of energetic rules and help better understand the folding of a secondary structure into its three-dimensional structure. These together suggest that helix capping likely play a fundamental role in driving RNA folding.},

  abstract       = {A significant fraction of the bases in a folded, structured RNA molecule participate in noncanonical base pairing interactions, often in the context of internal loops or multi-helix junction loops. The appearance of each new high-resolution RNA structure provides welcome data to guide efforts to understand and predict RNA 3D structure, especially when the RNA in question is a functionally conserved molecule. The recent publication of the crystal structure of the "Loop E" region of bacterial 5S ribosomal RNA is such an event [Correll CC, Freeborn B, Moore PB, Steitz TA, 1997, Cell 91:705-712]. In addition to providing more examples of already established noncanonical base pairs, such as purine-purine sheared pairings, trans-Hoogsteen UA, and GU wobble pairs, the structure provides the first high-resolution views of two new purine-purine pairings and a new GU pairing. The goal of the present analysis is to expand the capabilities of both chemical probing and phylogenetic analysis to predict with greater accuracy the structures of RNA molecules. First, in light of existing chemical probing data, we investigate what lessons could be learned regarding the interpretation of this widely used method of RNA structure probing. Then we analyze the 3D structure with reference to molecular phylogeny data (assuming conservation of function) to discover what alternative base pairings are geometrically compatible with the structure. The comparisons between previous modeling efforts and crystal structures show that the intricate involvements of ions and water molecules in the maintenance of non-Watson-Crick pairs render the process of correctly identifying the interacting sites in such pairs treacherous, except in cases of trans-Hoogsteen A/U or sheared A/G pairs for the adenine N1 site. The phylogenetic analysis identifies A/A, A/C, A/U and C/A, C/C, and C/U pairings isosteric with sheared A/G, as well as A/A and A/C pairings isosteric with both G/U and G/G bifurcated pairings. Thus, each non-Watson-Crick pair could be characterized by a phylogenetic signature of variations between isosteric-like pairings. In addition to the conservative changes, which form a dictionary of pairings isosterically compatible with those observed in the crystal structure, concerted changes involving several base pairs also occur. The latter covariations may indicate transitions between related but distinctive motifs within the loop E of 5S ribosomal RNA.},

  abstract       = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge, hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

present an overview of the methods used to determine small RNA structures with an emphasis on
RNA preparation, crystallization, and structure refinement. We draw upon examples from our own
research in the analysis of the leadzyme ribozyme, the hairpin ribozyme, a class I preQ1
riboswitch, and variants of a larger class II preQ1 riboswitch. The methods presented provide a
guide for comparable investigations of noncoding RNA molecules including a 48-solution, “first

  abstract       = {Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and melanoma differentiation-associated antigen 5 (RIG-I/MDA-5) helicases are known to sense double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus and initiate antiviral responses, such as production of type-I interferons (IFNs). Recognition of dsRNA by TLR3 or RIG-I/MDA-5 is cell-type-dependent and recent studies have shown a direct link between TLRs and hematopoiesis. We hypothesized that viral dsRNA recognized by either TLR3 or RIG-I/MDA-5, affects the growth of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here we show that polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-mediated very rapid apoptosis occurs within 1 hour in CD34(+) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid, another synthetic dsRNA that signals only through TLR3, had no effect. Poly I:C-LMW/LyoVec, a complex between low molecular-weight poly I:C and the transfection reagent LyoVec, which signals only through RIG-I/MDA-5, induces apoptosis of CD34(+) cells. A strong and sustained upregulation of messenger RNA and protein levels of Noxa, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein that can be induced by RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway, is found in CD34(+) cells treated by poly I:C. Although poly I:C upregulates type-I IFNs in CD34(+) cells, neither exogenous IFN-âÃ©Â¬Â± nor IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ induces rapid apoptosis in CD34(+) cells and neutralization or blocking of type-I IFN receptor does not rescue CD34(+) cells, whereas Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, rescues the cells from apoptosis. These results suggest that RIG-I/MDA-5, but not TLR3, signaling triggers poly I:C-induced rapid apoptosis of human CD34(+) cells, which will provide an insight into the mechanisms of dsRNA virus-mediated hematopoietic disorders.},

  abstract       = {We present a comprehensive software package, 3DNA, for the analysis, reconstruction and visualization of three-dimensional nucleic acid structures. Starting from a coordinate file in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, 3DNA can handle antiparallel and parallel double helices, single-stranded structures, triplexes, quadruplexes and other complex tertiary folding motifs found in both DNA and RNA structures. The analysis routines identify and categorize all base interactions and classify the double helical character of appropriate base pair steps. The program makes use of a recently recommended reference frame for the description of nucleic acid base pair geometry and a rigorous matrix-based scheme to calculate local conformational parameters and rebuild the structure from these parameters. The rebuilding routines produce rectangular block representations of nucleic acids as well as full atomic models with the sugar-phosphate backbone and publication quality 'standardized' base stacking diagrams. Utilities are provided to locate the base pairs and helical regions in a structure and to reorient structures for effective visualization. Regular helical models based on X-ray diffraction measurements of various repeating sequences can also be generated within the program.},

  abstract       = {Rapid and robust induction of type I IFN (IFN-I) is a critical event in host antiviral innate immune response. It has been well demonstrated that cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) plays an important role in sensing cytosolic DNA and triggering STING dependent signaling to induce IFN-I. However, it is largely unknown how cGAS itself is regulated during pathogen infection and IFN-I production. In this study, we show that pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands, including lipid A, LPS, poly(I:C), poly(dA:dT), and cGAMP, induce cGAS expression in an IFN-I-dependent manner in both mouse and human macrophages. Further experiments indicated that cGAS is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), and two adjacent IFN-sensitive response elements (ISREs) in the promoter region of cGAS mediate the induction of cGAS by IFN-I. Additionally, we show that optimal production of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ triggered by poly (dA:dT) or HSV-1 requires IFNAR signaling. Knockdown of the constitutively expressed DNA sensor DDX41 attenuates poly(dA:dT)-triggered IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ production and cGAS induction. By analyzing the dynamic expression of poly(dA:dT)-induced IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ and cGAS transcripts, we have found that induction of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ is earlier than cGAS. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that induction of cGAS by IFN-I meditates the subsequent positive feedback regulation of DNA-triggered IFN-I production. Thus, our study not only provides a novel mechanism of modulating cGAS expression, but also adds another layer of regulation in DNA-triggered IFN-I production by induction of cGAS.},

  abstract       = {Mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastids require extensive U-insertion/deletion editing that progresses 3'-to-5' in small blocks, each directed by a guide RNA (gRNA), and exhibits substrate and developmental stage-specificity by unsolved mechanisms. Here, we address compositionally related factors, collectively known as the mitochondrial RNA-binding complex 1 (MRB1) or gRNA-binding complex (GRBC), that contain gRNA, have a dynamic protein composition, and transiently associate with several mitochondrial factors including RNA editing core complexes (RECC) and ribosomes. MRB1 controls editing by still unknown mechanisms. We performed the first next-generation sequencing study of native subcomplexes of MRB1, immunoselected via either RNA helicase 2 (REH2), that binds RNA and associates with unwinding activity, or MRB3010, that affects an early editing step. The particles contain either REH2 or MRB3010 but share the core GAP1 and other proteins detected by RNA photo-crosslinking. Analyses of the first editing blocks indicate an enrichment of several initiating gRNAs in the MRB3010-purified complex. Our data also indicate fast evolution of mRNA 3' ends and strain-specific alternative 3' editing within 3' UTR or C-terminal protein-coding sequence that could impact mitochondrial physiology. Moreover, we found robust specific copurification of edited and pre-edited mRNAs, suggesting that these particles may bind both mRNA and gRNA editing substrates. We propose that multiple subcomplexes of MRB1 with different RNA/protein composition serve as a scaffold for specific assembly of editing substrates and RECC, thereby forming the editing holoenzyme. The MRB3010-subcomplex may promote early editing through its preferential recruitment of initiating gRNAs.},

  abstract       = {Pyrimidine oligonucleotides recognize extended purine sequences in the major groove of double-helical DNA by triple-helix formation. The resulting local triple helices are relatively stable and can block DNA recognition by sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as restriction endonucleases. Association and dissociation kinetics for the oligodeoxyribonucleotide 5'-CTCTTTCCTCTCTTTTTCCCC (bold C's indicate 5-methylcytosine residues) are now measured with a restriction endonuclease protection assay. When oligonucleotides are present in greater than 10-fold excess over the DNA target site, the binding reaction kinetics are pseudo first order in oligonucleotide concentration. Under our standard conditions (37 degrees C, 25 mM Tris-acetate, pH 6.8, 70 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM magnesium chloride, 0.4 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin) the value of the observed pseudo-first-order association rate constant, k2obs, is 1.8 x 10(3) +/- 1.9 x 10(2) L.(mol of oligomer-1.s-1. Measurement of the dissociation rate constant yields an equilibrium dissociation constant of approximately 10 nM. Increasing sodium ion concentration slightly decreased the association rate, substantially increased the dissociation rate, and thereby reduced the equilibrium binding constant. This effect was reversible by increasing multivalent cation concentration, confirming the significant role of multivalent cations in oligonucleotide-directed triple-helix formation under these conditions. Finally, a small reduction in association rate, a large increase in dissociation rate, and a resulting reduction in the equilibrium binding constant were observed upon increasing the pH between 6.8 and 7.2.},

  abstract       = {Human HepaRG cells are liver progenitors which possess hepatocyte-like functionality. We investigated the effects of double-stranded (ds) RNA on interferon (IFN)-beta and chemokine (CK) expression in these cells. By microarray and ELISA, we showed strong induction of CXCL10 and interleulin (IL)-8 besides IFN-beta and other CK ligands. RNA interference directed silencing of TLR3, RIG-I, IRF3, NFkappaB or MAP kinases (p38, ERK, JNK) was carried out. Knockdown of all these molecules, except ERK and JNK, blocked IFN-beta production. Both TLR3 and RIG-I are required for CXCL10 expression. Silencing of TLR3 completely impaired the IL-8 expression. dsRNA-conditioned medium from HepaRG cells exerted a drastic antiviral effect in HCV replicons, and in the JFH-1-based HCV production cell culture system. The IFN-beta knockdown in HepaRG cells removed this antiviral effect but did not enhance their capacity to initiate HCV RNA replication. We conclude that dsRNA induces antiviral and pro-inflammatory status in HepaRG cells.},

  abstract       = {The immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) make them an attractive therapeutic tool to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. These indications are characterized by a chronic activation of immune cells that perpetuates the disease. In vitro, when adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) are cultured with T lymphocytes at the time of stimulation, their proliferation is inhibited. However, these experimental settings do not necessarily fit with what ASCs will face in inflammatory conditions in vivo, where ASCs will likely encounter and interact with already activated immune cells which might affect their immunomodulatory capacity. In most in vitro studies, MSCs have been cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells at the time of lymphocyte stimulation and information about the interaction between MSCs and prestimulated lymphocytes in vitro is scarce. Therefore, a better understanding of the capacity of MSCs to modulate the responses of preactivated immune cells is needed. In this study we focused on the effects of ASCs on prestimulated lymphocytes and systematically investigated the potential mechanisms involved. We report that prestimulation of T lymphocytes 48 h before the coculture with ASCs impairs the capacity of ASCs to inhibit proliferation. Preactivation of ASCs with interferon âÃ©Â¬â¥ or the toll-like receptor ligand Poly I:C, but not other stimuli tested, enhanced the ability to inhibit the proliferation of 48 h-stimulated T lymphocytes. The inhibitory effect of ASCs was shown to be time dependent and mediated through the actual magnitude of tryptophan degradation by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.},

  abstract       = {Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation on microglia and astrocytes are key elements in neuroinflammation which accompanies a number of neurological disorders. While TLR activation on glia is well-established to up-regulate pro-inflammatory mediator expression, much less is known about how ligand engagement of one TLR may affect expression of other TLRs on microglia and astrocytes.\\ In the present study, we evaluated the effects of agonists for TLR2 (zymosan), TLR3 (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analogue of double-stranded RNA) and TLR4 (lipopolysaccaride (LPS)) in influencing expression of their cognate receptor as well as that of the other TLRs in cultures of rat cortical purified microglia (>99.5 %) and nominally microglia-free astrocytes. Elimination of residual microglia (a common contaminant of astrocyte cultures) was achieved by incubation with the lysosomotropic agent L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (L-LME).\\ Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the purity (essentially 100 %) of the obtained microglia, and up to 5 % microglia contamination of astrocytes. L-LME treatment effectively removed microglia from the latter (real-time polymerase chain reaction). The three TLR ligands robustly up-regulated gene expression for pro-inflammatory markers (interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor) in microglia and enriched, but not purified, astrocytes, confirming cellular functionality. LPS, zymosan and poly(I:C) all down-regulated TLR4 messenger RNA (mRNA) and up-regulated TLR2 mRNA at 6 and 24 h. In spite of their inability to elaborate pro-inflammatory mediator output, the nominally microglia-free astrocytes (>99 % purity) also showed similar behaviours to those of microglia, as well as changes in TLR3 gene expression. LPS interaction with TLR4 activates downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B signalling pathways and subsequently causes inflammatory mediator production. The effects of LPS on TLR2 mRNA in both cell populations were antagonized by a nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B inhibitor.\\ TLR2 and TLR4 activation in particular, in concert with microglia and astrocytes, comprise key elements in the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The finding that both homologous (zymosan) and heterologous (LPS, poly(I:C)) TLR ligands are capable of regulating TLR2 gene expression, in particular, may have important implications in understanding the relative contributions of different TLRs in neurological disorders associated with neuroinflammation.},

  abstract       = {Viral diseases are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in oysters, resulting in significant economic losses. We investigated the proteomic responses of these two species of oysters to generic double-stranded RNAs (poly I:C and poly A:U). Analysis of proteomic data using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitaion (iTRAQ) indicated that there were significant differences in the proteomic responses of the two oyster species resulting from this treatment. Gene ontology analysis showed that several biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function were unique to the different data sets. For example, a number of proteins implicated in the TLR signaling pathway were associated with the Saccostrea glomerata data set but were absent in the Crassostra gigas data set. These results suggest that the differences in the proteomic responses to dsRNA may underpin the biological differences in viral susceptibility. Molecular targets previously shown to be expressed in C. gigas in response to OsHV1 infections were not present in our proteomic data sets, although they were present in the RNA extracted from the very same tissues. Taken together, our data indicate that there are substantial disparities between transcriptomic and proteomic responses to dsRNA challenge, and a comprehensive account of the oysters' biological responses to these treatments must take into account that disparity.},

  abstract       = {Chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are common respiratory disorders worldwide. Exacerbations of these diseases are frequent and worsen patients' respiratory condition and overall health. However, the mechanisms of exacerbation have not been fully elucidated. Recently, it was reported that interleukin (IL)-17A might play an important role in neutrophilic inflammation, which is characteristic of such exacerbations, through increased production of neutrophil chemoattractants. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-17A was involved in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation, due to viral infection in chronic inflammatory airway diseases. In this study, we assessed chemokine production by bronchial epithelial cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Comprehensive chemokine analysis showed that, compared with poly(I:C) alone, co-stimulation of BEAS-2B cells with IL-17A and poly(I:C) strongly induced production of such neutrophil chemoattractants as CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)8, growth-related oncogene (GRO), and CXCL1. Co-stimulation synergistically induced CXCL8 and CXCL1 mRNA and protein production by BEAS-2B cells and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Poly(I:C) induced chemokine expression by BEAS-2B cells mainly via Toll-like receptor 3/TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-âÃ©Â¬â¤-mediated signals. The co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) markedly activated the p38 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway, compared with poly(I:C), although there was little change in nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B translocation into the nucleus or the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B and activator protein 1. IL-17A promoted stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA in BEAS-2B cells treated with poly(I:C). In conclusion, IL-17A appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory airway disease exacerbation, due to viral infection by promoting release of neutrophil chemoattractants from bronchial epithelial cells.},

These basepairs are classified according to their tertiary interactions, and sequence conservation at their positions is determined. G/U basepairs participating in tertiary interactions are more conserved than those lacking any interactions. Specific interactions occurring in the G/U shallow groove pocket--like packing interactions (P-interactions) and some phosphate backbone interactions (phosphate-in-pocket interactions)--lead to higher G/U conservation than others. Two salient cases of unique phylogenetic compensation are discovered. First, a P-interaction is conserved through a series of compensatory mutations involving all four participating nucleotides to preserve or restore the G/U in the optimal orientation. Second, a G/U basepair forming a P-interaction and another one forming a phosphate-in-pocket interaction are replaced by GNRA loops that maintain similar tertiary contacts. MD simulations were carried out on eight P-interactions. The specific GU/CG signature of this interaction observed in structure and sequence analysis was rationalized, and can now be used for improving sequence alignments.},

The almost three helical turns of the RNA in the asymmetric unit introduced partial or imperfect translational pseudosymmetry (TPS) that modulated the intensities when averaged by the l Miller indices but still escaped automated detection. Almost six times as many random phase sets had to be tested on average to reach a correct structure compared with a similar-sized RNA hairpin (27 nucleotides, 580 non-H RNA atoms) without TPS. More sensitive methods are needed for the automated detection of partial TPS.},

Also, in response to suggestions that the charged residues Lys85 and Asp89, which are 5-8 A away, may have important effects, each of these amino acids was replaced with alanine. Crystal structures were determined for many of the variants. With the exception of the tryptophan and valine mutants R96W and R96V, the crystallographic analysis shows that the substituted side chain following the path of Arg96 in wildtype (WT). The melting temperatures of the variants decrease by up to approximately 16 degrees C with WT being most stable. There are two site 96 replacements, with lysine or glutamine, that leave the stability close to that of WT. The only element that the side chains of these residues have in common with the WT arginine is the set of three carbon atoms at the C(alpha), C(beta), and C(gamma) positions. Although each side chain is long and flexible with a polar group at the distal position, the details of the hydrogen bonding to the rest of the protein differ in each case. Also, the glutamine replacement lacks a positive charge. This shows that there is some adaptability in achieving full stabilization at this site. At the other extreme, to be maximally destabilizing a mutation at site 96 must not only eliminate favorable interactions but also introduce an unfavorable element such as steric strain or a hydrogen-bonding group that remains unsatisfied. Overall, the study highlights the essential need for atomic resolution site-specific structural information to understand and to predict the stability of mutant proteins. It can be very misleading to simply assume that conservative amino acid substitutions cause small changes in stability, whereas large stability changes are associated with nonconservative replacements.},

  abstract       = {Automated protein redesign, as implemented in the program ORBIT, was used to redesign the core of phage T4 lysozyme. A total of 26 buried or partially buried sites in the C-terminal domain were allowed to vary both their sequence and side-chain conformation while the backbone and non-selected side-chains remained fixed. A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.},

The overhanging nucleotide from one strand remains stacked and sandwiched between the blunt-ends of two adjacent Z-DNA duplexes, while the overhanging base of the opposing strand is extra-helical. The stacked and the extra-helical bases from adjacent duplexes pair to form a distorted d(G x G) reverse Hoogsteen base-pair in the d(Gm5CGCGCG)2 homoduplex, and d(G x T) reverse wobble and d(G x C) reverse Watson-Crick base-pairs in the d(GCGCGCG)/d(TCGCGCG) and d(GCGCGCG)/d(CCGCGCG) heteroduplexes, respectively.

To estimate the relative stability of the three types of reverse base-pairs, crystals were grown using various mixtures of sequences and their strand compositions analyzed by mass spectrometry. The d(G x C) reverse Watson-Crick base-pair was estimated to be more stable by approximately 1.5 kcal/mol and the d(G x T) reverse wobble base-pair more stable by approximately 0.5 kcal/mol than the d(G x G) reverse Hoogsteen base-pair.

In the corresponding mRNA transcript, the CUG repeats form an extended stem-loop structure. The double-stranded RNA of the stem sequesters RNA binding proteins away from their normal cellular targets resulting in aberrant transcription, alternative splicing patterns, or both, thereby leading to DM. To better understand the structural basis of DM type 1, we determined to 1.58-A resolution the x-ray crystal structure of an 18-bp RNA containing six CUG repeats. The CUG repeats form antiparallel double-stranded helices that stack end-on-end in the crystal to form infinite, pseudocontinuous helices similar to the long CUG stem loops formed by the expanded CUG repeats in DM type 1. The CUG helix is very similar in structure to A-form RNA with the exception of the unique U-U mismatches. This structure provides a high-resolution view of a toxic, trinucleotide repeat RNA.},

  abstract       = {Proteins with more than 1000 non-H atoms and without heavy-atom prosthetic groups are very difficult to solve by ab initio direct methods. T4 lysozyme is being used to explore these limits. The protein has 1309 non-H atoms, seven S atoms, no disulfide bonds and no heavy-atom prosthetic group. It is recalcitrant to structure determination by direct methods using X-ray diffraction data to 0.97 A. It is shown here that it is possible to obtain a truly ab initio structure determination of a variant of the protein that has an Rb+ (Z = 37) binding site. Using diffraction data to 1.06 A resolution, the direct-methods programs SIR2002 and ACORN independently solved the structure in about 20 h. The bound Rb+, which contributes about 1.7% of the total scattering, does not appear to distort the structure or to inhibit refinement (R factor 12.1%). The phases obtained via SIR2002 or ACORN are in good agreement with those from a reference structure obtained from conventional molecular-substitution and refinement procedures (average error in the figure-of-merit-weighted phases of less than 25 degrees). Thus, proteins with more than 1000 atoms that include halide-binding or other such sites may be amenable to structure determination by ab initio direct methods. The direct-methods approaches are also compared with structure determination via use of the anomalous scattering of the Rb+ ion. As shown by examples, high-resolution structures determined by direct methods can be useful in highlighting regions of strain in the protein, including short hydrogen bonds and non-planar peptide groups.},

  abstract       = {We have solved the single-crystal X-ray structures of two different hexanucleotides: the alternating sequence d(Gm5CGm5CGC), and the non-alternating sequence d(Gm5CCGGC). Both of these hexamers crystallize readily as A-DNA in the orthorhombic space group C222(1). Although hexanucleotides have been previously crystallized as Z-DNA, and in one case as B-DNA, this is the first time hexanucleotides have been crystallized as A-DNA. Both hexamers adopt a typical A-conformation, which is surprisingly more similar to the structure of A-DNA fibers than to other A-DNA single crystals. The structure of d(Gm5CGm5CGC) was solved to a resolution of 2.1 A (R-factor = 19.6%). This structure has all of the features characteristic of canonical A-DNA, including it's helical repeat (11.2 bp/turn), helical rise (2.6 A/bp), base-pair displacement (-4.7 A), base inclination angle (16.9 degrees), and sugar puckers that are predominantly 3'-endo. The lower resolution, non-alternating structure has similar overall average values for these parameters. We observed several sequence-dependent correlations in these parameters, especially in the d(CG) base step. These steps have lower twist and rise values, coupled with high roll angles as compared to d(GC) steps. The molecular interactions involved in crystal packing and the detailed structure of the bound water in the crystals, however, are similar to those of longer 8 and 10 bp A-DNA crystal structures. Although the structural effect of cytosine methylation on A-DNA appears to be minimal, this modification significantly affects the ability of these sequences to crystallize as A-DNA. In conclusion, we present the A-DNA forming class of hexanucleotides, a new crystallographic system for studying DNA structure at near atomic resolution.},

  abstract       = {Proteins of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing family recently gained attention as important components of the innate immune system. Although over 20 of these proteins are present in humans, only a few members including the cytosolic pattern recognition receptors NOD1, NOD2, and NLRP3 have been analyzed extensively. These NLRs were shown to be pivotal for mounting innate immune response toward microbial invasion. Here we report on the characterization of human NLRC5 and provide evidence that this NLR has a function in innate immune responses. We found that NLRC5 is a cytosolic protein expressed predominantly in hematopoetic cells. NLRC5 mRNA and protein expression was inducible by the double-stranded RNA analog poly(I.C) and Sendai virus. Overexpression of NLRC5 failed to trigger inflammatory responses such as the NF-kappaB or interferon pathways in HEK293T cells. However, knockdown of endogenous NLRC5 reduced Sendai virus- and poly(I.C)-mediated type I interferon pathway-dependent responses in THP-1 cells and human primary dermal fibroblasts. Taken together, this defines a function for NLRC5 in anti-viral innate immune responses.},

  abstract       = {We have applied tethered particle microscopy (TPM) as a single molecule analysis tool to studies of the conformational dynamics of poly-uridine(U) messenger (m)RNA and 16S ribosomal (r)RNA molecules. Using stroboscopic total internal reflection illumination and rigorous selection criteria to distinguish from nonspecific tethering, we have tracked the nanometer-scale Brownian motion of RNA-tethered fluorescent microspheres in all three dimensions at pH 7.5, 22 degrees C, in 10 mM or 100 mM NaCl in the absence or presence of 10 mM MgCl(2). The addition of Mg(2+) to low-ionic strength buffer results in significant compaction and stiffening of poly(U) mRNA, but not of 16S rRNA. Furthermore, the motion of poly(U)-tethered microspheres is more heterogeneous than that of 16S rRNA-tethered microspheres. Analysis of in-plane bead motion suggests that poly(U) RNA, but less so 16S rRNA, can be modeled both in the presence and absence of Mg(2+) by a statistical Gaussian polymer model. We attribute these differences to the Mg(2+)-induced compaction of the relatively weakly structured and structurally disperse poly(U) mRNA, in contrast to Mg(2+)-induced reinforcement of existing secondary and tertiary structure contacts in the highly structured 16S rRNA. Both effects are nonspecific, however, as they are dampened in the presence of higher concentrations of monovalent cations.},

  abstract       = {Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) is a plant defense response that relies on the perception of conserved microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs or PAMPs, respectively). Recently, it has been recognized that PTI restricts virus infection in plants; however, the nature of the viral or infection-induced PTI elicitors and the underlying signaling pathways are still unknown. As double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are conserved molecular patterns associated with virus replication, we applied dsRNAs or synthetic dsRNA analogs to Arabidopsis thaliana and investigated PTI responses. We show that in vitro-generated dsRNAs, dsRNAs purified from virus-infected plants and the dsRNA analog polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) induce typical PTI responses dependent on the co-receptor SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 (SERK1), but independent of dicer-like (DCL) proteins in Arabidopsis. Moreover, dsRNA treatment of Arabidopsis induces SERK1-dependent antiviral resistance. Screening of Arabidopsis wild accessions demonstrates natural variability in dsRNA sensitivity. Our findings suggest that dsRNAs represent genuine PAMPs in plants, which induce a signaling cascade involving SERK1 and a specific dsRNA receptor. The dependence of dsRNA-mediated PTI on SERK1, but not on DCLs, implies that dsRNA-mediated PTI involves membrane-associated processes and operates independently of RNA silencing. dsRNA sensitivity may represent a useful trait to increase antiviral resistance in cultivated plants.},

  abstract       = {The deformability of double helical DNA is critical for its packaging in the cell, recognition by other molecules, and transient opening during biochemically important processes. Here, a complete set of sequence-dependent empirical energy functions suitable for describing such behavior is extracted from the fluctuations and correlations of structural parameters in DNA-protein crystal complexes. These elastic functions provide useful stereochemical measures of the local base step movements operative in sequence-specific recognition and protein-induced deformations. In particular, the pyrimidine-purine dimers stand out as the most variable steps in the DNA-protein complexes, apparently acting as flexible "hinges" fitting the duplex to the protein surface. In addition to the angular parameters widely used to describe DNA deformations (i.e., the bend and twist angles), the translational parameters describing the displacements of base pairs along and across the helical axis are analyzed. The observed correlations of base pair bending and shearing motions are important for nonplanar folding of DNA in nucleosomes and other nucleoprotein complexes. The knowledge-based energies also offer realistic three-dimensional models for the study of long DNA polymers at the global level, incorporating structural features beyond the scope of conventional elastic rod treatments and adding a new dimension to literal analyses of genomic sequences.},

  abstract       = {Several general principles emerge from the studies of Cro, lambda repressor, and CAP. The DNA-binding sites are recognized in a form similar to B-DNA. They do not form cruciforms or other novel DNA structures. There seem to be proteins that bind left-handed Z-DNA (87) and DNA in other conformations, but it remains to be seen how these structures are recognized or how proteins recognize specific sequences in single-stranded DNA. Cro, repressor, and CAP use symmetrically related subunits to interact with two-fold related sites in the operator sequences. Many other DNA-binding proteins are dimers or tetramers and their operator sequences have approximate two-fold symmetry. It seems likely that these proteins will, like Cro, repressor, and CAP, form symmetric complexes. However, there is no requirement for symmetry in protein-DNA interactions. Some sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, like RNA polymerase, do not have symmetrically related subunits and do not bind to symmetric recognition sequences. Cro, repressor, and CAP use alpha-helices for many of the contacts between side chains and bases in the major groove. An adjacent alpha-helical region contacts the DNA backbone and may help to orient the "recognition" helices. This use of alpha-helical regions for DNA binding appears to be a common mode of recognition. Most of the contacts made by Cro, repressor, and CAP occur on one side of the double helix. However, lambda repressor contacts both sides of the double helix by using a flexible region of protein to wrap around the DNA. Recognition of specific base sequences involves hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between side chains and the edges of base pairs. These specific interactions, together with backbone interactions and electrostatic interactions, stabilize the protein-DNA complexes. The current models for the complexes of Cro, repressor, and CAP with operator DNA are probably fundamentally correct, but it should be emphasized that model building alone, even when coupled with genetic and biochemical studies, cannot be expected to provide a completely reliable "high-resolution" view of the protein-DNA complex. For example, the use of standard B-DNA geometry for the operator is clearly an approximation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract       = {The classical RNA secondary structure model considers A.U and G.C Watson-Crick as well as G.U wobble base pairs. Here we substitute it for a new one, in which sets of nucleotide cyclic motifs define RNA structures. This model allows us to unify all base pairing energetic contributions in an effective scoring function to tackle the problem of RNA folding. We show how pipelining two computer algorithms based on nucleotide cyclic motifs, MC-Fold and MC-Sym, reproduces a series of experimentally determined RNA three-dimensional structures from the sequence. This demonstrates how crucial the consideration of all base-pairing interactions is in filling the gap between sequence and structure. We use the pipeline to define rules of precursor microRNA folding in double helices, despite the presence of a number of presumed mismatches and bulges, and to propose a new model of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 -1 frame-shifting element.},

  abstract       = {Maternal immune activation (MIA) resulting from prenatal exposure to infectious pathogens or inflammatory stimuli is increasingly recognized to play an important etiological role in neuropsychiatric disorders with neurodevelopmental features. MIA in pregnant rodents induced by injection of the synthetic double-stranded RNA, Poly I:C, a mimic of viral infection, leads to a wide spectrum of behavioral abnormalities as well as structural and functional defects in the brain. Previous MIA studies using poly I:C prenatal treatment suggested that neurophysiological alterations occur in the hippocampus. However, these investigations used only juvenile or adult animals. We postulated that MIA-induced alterations could occur earlier at neonatal/early postnatal stages. Here we examined the neurophysiological properties of cultured pyramidal-like hippocampal neurons prepared from neonatal (P0-P2) offspring of pregnant rats injected with poly I:C. Offspring neurons from poly I:C-treated mothers exhibited significantly lower intrinsic excitability and stronger spike frequency adaptation, compared to saline. A similar lower intrinsic excitability was observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons from hippocampal slices of two weeks-old poly I:C offspring. Cultured hippocampal neurons also displayed lower frequency of spontaneous firing, higher charge transfer of IPSCs and larger amplitude of miniature IPSCs. Thus, maternal immune activation leads to strikingly early neurophysiological abnormalities in hippocampal neurons.},

  abstract       = {Because of the labor-intensive and time-consuming conventional protocols for the generation of dendritic cells (DCs) as the most promising tools for anti-cancer therapy that enable the induction of a T-helper (Th)1-mediated anti-tumor immune response, the use of short-term protocols has been proposed. However, data on the applicability of such protocols in cancer immunotherapy are quite limited.\\ We compared the phenotypic and functional capability of fast DCs (fDCs) differentiated for 24 h and then matured for 48 h with Poly (I:C), a strong Th1-promoting agent, with donor-matched conventional DCs (cDCs) differentiated for 5 days and matured likewise.\\ Of 12 donors tested, we identified seven whose monocytes failed to develop into immunogenic DCs through the use of fDC protocol, on the basis of incomplete downregulation of CD14, low expression of CD1a and macrophage-like morphology. Such fDCs have significantly lower expression of CD83, CD86, CCR7 and CD40, weaker allo-stimulatory Th1- and Th17-polarizing capacity caused by poor production of interleukin (IL)-12p70 and IL-23 and high production of IL-10, and prominent Th2-polarizing capacity, compared with donor-matched cDCs. Furthermore, such fDCs had tolerogenic properties as judged by higher expression of indolamine dioxigenase-3, IDO-1 and IL-1âÃ©Â¬â¤ and induction of a higher percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells. These findings correlated with increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-âÃ©Â¬â¤ production by fDC-primed CD3(+)T cells and their stronger anti-proliferative capacity.\\ We emphasize that although fDCs could probably be applied as an alternative to cDCs for cancer therapy, the fDC protocol should not be applied to donors whose DCs acquire tolerogenic capabilities.},

  abstract       = {Expression of the structural proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the direct interaction of multiple copies of the viral protein Rev with its target RNA, the Rev response element (RRE). RRE is a complex 351-nt RNA that is highly structured and located within the viral env gene. During initial Rev-RRE recognition, Rev binds with high affinity to a bubble structure located within the RRE RNA stem-loop II. We have used a site-specific photocrosslinking method based on 6-thioguanosine (6-thioG) photochemistry to probe the conformation of the high-affinity binding site of RRE RNA and its interactions with Rev protein under physiological conditions. A minimal duplex RNA containing the bubble region of RRE and 12 flanking base pairs was synthesized chemically. Two different RRE constructs with a single photoactive nucleoside (6-thio-dG or 6-thioG) at position 47 or 48 were synthesized. Upon UV irradiation, 6-thioG at both positions formed interstrand covalent crosslinks in RRE RNA. Mapping of crosslink sites by RNA sequencing revealed that 6-thioG at position 47 or 48 crosslinked to A73. In the presence of Rev, both RNA-RNA and RNA-protein crosslinks were observed, however, the RNA-RNA crosslink site was unchanged. Our results provide direct evidence that, during RNA-protein recognition, Rev is in close proximity to O6 of G47 and G48 in the major groove of RRE RNA. Our results also show that the bubble region of RRE RNA has a biologically relevant structure where G47 and G48 are in close proximity to A73 and this RNA structure is not changed significantly upon Rev binding. We propose that Rev protein recognizes and binds to specific structural elements of RRE RNA containing non-Watson-Crick base pairs and such structures could be a determinant for recognition by other RNA-binding proteins. Our site-specific crosslinking methods provide a general approach to capture dynamic states of biologically relevant RNA structures that are otherwise missed by NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies.},

  abstract       = {Specific gene expression involves the binding of natural ligands to the DNA base pairs. Among the compounds rationally designed for artificial regulation of gene expression, oligonucleotides can bind with a high specificity of recognition to the major groove of double helical DNA by forming Hoogsteen type bonds with purine bases of the Watson-Crick base pairs, resulting in triple helix formation. Although the potential target sequences were originally restricted to polypurine-polypyrimidine sequences, considerable efforts were devoted to the extension of the repertoire by rational conception of appropriate derivatives. Efficient tools based on triple helices were developed for various biochemical applications such as the development of highly specific artificial nucleases. The antigene strategy remains one of the most fascinating fields of triplex application to selectively control gene expression. Targeting of genomic sequences is now proved to be a valuable concept on a still limited number of studies; local mutagenesis is in this respect an interesting application of triplex-forming oligonucleotides on cell cultures. Oligonucleotide penetration and compartmentalization in cells, stability to intracellular nucleases, accessibility of the target sequences in the chromatin context, the residence time on the specific target are all limiting steps that require further optimization. The existence and the role of three-stranded DNA in vivo, its interaction with intracellular proteins is worth investigating, especially relative to the regulation of gene transcription, recombination and repair processes.},

  abstract       = {The aim of our study was to investigate the brain-specific epigenetic effects on global enzymatic histone deacetylase (HDAC) and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity after prenatal exposure to maternal immune challenge by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) at gestational day (GD) 17 in C57BL/6JRccHsd mouse offspring. Pregnant mice were randomly divided into 2 groups, receiving either 5 mg/kg Poly I:C or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intravenously at GD 17. Subsequently, the effects on whole brain enzymatic HDAC and DNMT activity and the protein levels of various HDAC isoforms were assessed in the offspring. Overall, a significant sex âÃ³ treatment interaction effect was observed after prenatal exposure to maternal immune challenge by Poly I:C, indicative of increased global HDAC activity particularly in female offspring from mothers injected with Poly I:C when compared to controls. Results on the levels of specific HDAC isoforms suggested that neither differences in the levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4 or HDAC6 could explain the increased global HDAC activity observed in female Poly I:C offspring. In conclusion, we show that Poly I:C administration to pregnant mice alters global brain HDAC, but not DNMT activity in adult offspring, whereas it is still unclear which specific HDAC(s) mediate(s) this effect. These results indicate the necessity for further research on the epigenetic effects of Poly I:C.},

  abstract       = {Calcineurin (CN) is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase which is a heterodimer composed of a 61 kDa catalytic subunit (CNA) and a 19 kDa regulatory subunit (CNB). The enzyme is critical for several important intracellular signal-transducing pathways, including T-cell activation. Its crystal structure reveals that the C-terminal of CNB lies in close vicinity of the N-terminal of CNA and each end has a long arm not involved in the active site. After fusing two subunits, it was determined that folding and function of the protein were not affected by the fusion. We amplified a fused gene of A and B subunits using a pair of linker primers including six codons of glycine. A single chain calcineurin was constructed and purified to near-homogeneity. The recombinant enzyme was fully soluble, displayed high specific activity with substrate, and exhibited biochemical properties and kinetic parameters similar to those of the native enzyme from the bovine brain. It was still activated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin but was not regulated by extra CNB and was still strongly stimulated by Mn(2+) and Ni(2+) divalent metal ions. The solution conformations of both recombinant enzyme and bovine calcineurin were assayed under the same conditions using intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, and results showed their graphs are approximately identical. Our findings suggested that the fusion of A and B subunits of calcineurin does not affect their folding pathways and structural changes involved in their function, furthermore, they are bound to the correct binding site.},

  abstract       = {The structure of human protein HSPC034 has been determined by both solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Refinement of the NMR structure ensemble, using a Rosetta protocol in the absence of NMR restraints, resulted in significant improvements not only in structure quality, but also in molecular replacement (MR) performance with the raw X-ray diffraction data using MOLREP and Phaser. This method has recently been shown to be generally applicable with improved MR performance demonstrated for eight NMR structures refined using Rosetta (Qian et al., Nature 2007;450:259-264). Additionally, NMR structures of HSPC034 calculated by standard methods that include NMR restraints have improvements in the RMSD to the crystal structure and MR performance in the order DYANA, CYANA, XPLOR-NIH, and CNS with explicit water refinement (CNSw). Further Rosetta refinement of the CNSw structures, perhaps due to more thorough conformational sampling and/or a superior force field, was capable of finding alternative low energy protein conformations that were equally consistent with the NMR data according to the Recall, Precision, and F-measure (RPF) scores. On further examination, the additional MR-performance shortfall for NMR refined structures as compared with the X-ray structure were attributed, in part, to crystal-packing effects, real structural differences, and inferior hydrogen bonding in the NMR structures. A good correlation between a decrease in the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and improved MR performance demonstrates the importance of hydrogen-bond terms in the force field for improving NMR structures. The superior hydrogen-bond network in Rosetta-refined structures demonstrates that correct identification of hydrogen bonds should be a critical goal of NMR structure refinement. Inclusion of nonbivalent hydrogen bonds identified from Rosetta structures as additional restraints in the structure calculation results in NMR structures with improved MR performance.},

  abstract       = {A macromolecular structure, as measured data or as a list of coordinates or even on-screen as a full atomic model, is an extremely complex and confusing object. The underlying rules of how it folds, moves, and interacts as a biological entity are even less evident or intuitive to the human mind. To do science on such molecules, or to relate them usefully to higher levels of biology, we need to start with a natural history that names their features in meaningful ways and with multiple representations (visual or algebraic) that show some aspect of their organizing principles. The two of us have jointly enjoyed a highly varied and engrossing career in biophysical research over nearly 50 years. Our frequent changes of emphasis are tied together by two threads: first, by finding the right names, visualizations, and methods to help both ourselves and others to better understand the 3D structures of protein and RNA molecules, and second, by redefining the boundary between signal and noise for complex data, in both directions-sometimes identifying and promoting real signal up out of what seemed just noise, and sometimes demoting apparent signal into noise or systematic error. Here we relate parts of our scientific and personal lives, including ups and downs, influences, anecdotes, and guiding principles such as the title theme.},

  abstract       = {Replication of human immunodeficiency virus requires Tat protein which activates elongation of RNA polymerase II transcription at the HIV-1 promoter through interaction with the cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor complex (P-TEFb). Tat binds directly through its transactivation domain to the CycT1 subunit of the P-TEFb and induces loop sequence specific binding of the P-TEFb onto nascent HIV-1 TAR RNA. By using a gel electrophoresis method and a comprehensive set of TAR loop mutants, we have identified the sequence and structural determinants for high-affinity CycT1-Tat-TAR ternary complex formation. Our results show that CycT1 and Tat binding to TAR RNA is highly cooperative, and a capacity of 85%, a Hill coefficient of 2.7, and a dissociation constant (K(D)) of 2.45 nM were observed. These results indicate that there are three binding sites on TAR RNA. CycT1 does not bind TAR RNA in the absence of Tat, and Tat binding to TAR, while detectable, is very inefficient in the absence of CycT1. It is conceivable that the CycT1-Tat heterodimer directly binds to TAR RNA in the U-rich RNA bulge region and this binding facilitates the interactions of the CycT1-Tat heterodimer at the other two sites in the RNA loop region. On the basis of our results, we suggest a model where CycT1 interacts with Tat protein and positions the protein complex to make contacts with the G34 region of the loop sequence; G34 is critical for CycT1-Tat binding and forms a C30.G34 base pair. Two functional groups, O6 and N7, at nucleotide positions 32 and 34 in the TAR loop are essential for CycT1-Tat interactions with TAR RNA. The identity of two nucleotides, U31 and G33, is not critical, but they contribute to the stabilization of the RNA-protein complex. The presence of a single-nucleotide bulge of A35 or C35 is essential for distortion of the backbone RNA structure as well as the accessibility of functional groups in the major groove of the double-helical region. CycT1-Tat interaction with TAR RNA represents another example of the flexibility and complexity of RNA structure involved in protein recognition.},

  abstract       = {In T4 lysozyme, helix A is located at the amino terminus of the sequence but is associated with the C-terminal domain in the folded structure. To investigate the implications of this arrangement for the folding of the protein, we first created a circularly permuted variant with a new amino terminus at residue 12. In effect, this moves the sequence corresponding to helix A from the N- to the C-terminus of the molecule. The protein crystallized nonisomorphously with the wild type but has a very similar structure, showing that the unit consisting of helix A and the C-terminal domain can be reconstituted from a contiguous polypeptide chain. The protein is less stable than the wild type but folds slightly faster. We then produced a second variant in which the helix A sequence was appended at the C-terminus (as in the first variant), but was also restored at the N-terminus (as in the wild type). This variant has two helix A sequences, one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus, each of which can compete for the same site in the folded protein. The crystal structure shows that it is the N-terminal sequence that folds in a manner similar to that of the wild type, whereas the copy at the C-terminus is forced to loop out. The stability of this protein is much closer to that of the wild type, but its rate of folding is significantly slower. The reduction in rate is attributed to the presence of the two identical sequence segments which compete for a single, mutually exclusive, site.},

  abstract       = {Type I interferons (IFNs), a family of cytokines, orchestrate numerous biological and cellular processes1, 2, 3. Although it is well known that type I IFNs are essential for establishing the host antiviral state4, their role in hematopoietic homeostasis has not been studied. Here we show that type I IFNs induce proliferation and exhaustion in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and that interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF2), a transcriptional suppressor of type I IFN signaling5, 6, preserves the self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capacity of HSCs. HSCs were substantially less abundant in the bone marrow of Irf2-/- as compared to Irf2+/- mice. Irf2-/- HSCs showed enhanced cell cycling status and failed to produce hematopoietic cells in competitive repopulation assays, and the reconstituting capacity of Irf2-/- HSCs was restored by disabling type I IFN signaling in these cells. In wild-type mice, injection of poly(I:C), an inducer of type I IFN signaling, or IFN- induced HSC proliferation, and chronic type I IFN signaling further reduced the number of quiescent HSCs. Notably, combined poly(I:C) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment allowed exogenous HSC engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution in WT mice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis for the maintenance of HSC quiescence and may lead to improvements in bone marrow transplantation and type I IFN-based therapies for viral infection and cancer.},

  abstract       = {Modern biotechnical research is becoming increasingly 	reliant on computational structural modeling programs to develop 	novel solutions to scientific questions. Rosetta is one such protein 	modeling suite that has already demonstrated wide applicability to a 	number of diverse research projects. Unfortunately, Rosetta is 	largely a command-line-driven software package which restricts its 	use among non-computational researchers. Some graphical interfaces 	for Rosetta exist, but typically are not as sophisticated as 	commercial software. Here, we present InteractiveROSETTA, a 	graphical interface for the PyRosetta framework that presents 	easy-to-use controls for several of the most widely used Rosetta 	protocols alongside a sophisticated selection system utilizing PyMOL 	as a visualizer. InteractiveROSETTA is also capable of interacting 	with remote Rosetta servers, facilitating sophisticated protocols 	that are not accessible in PyRosetta or which require greater 	computational resources. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: 	InteractiveROSETTA is freely available at 	https://github.com/schenc3/InteractiveROSETTA/releases and relies 	upon a separate download of PyRosetta which is available at 	http://www.pyrosetta.org after obtaining a license (free for 	academic use).

  abstract       = {Polyriboinosinic-polycytidylic acid with poly-L-lysine stabilized with carboxymethylcellulose [poly(I,C)-LC] augmented, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, secretion of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) by peritoneal macrophages (M phi) and bone marrow cells (BMC). Optimal effects were found after 2 days of in vitro culture of the cells with 50 micrograms/ml of poly(I,C)-LC or 14 h to 3 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of 1-2 mg/kg of poly(I,C)-LC into normal mice. The increase in CSF secretion by M phi and BMC was paralleled in vivo by an increase in serum CSF levels, followed by a rise in committed granulocyte and M phi progenitor cells (GM-CFU-C), nucleated BMC, and blood leukocytes of myelomonocytic origin. Poly(I,C)-LC at doses greater than 4 mg/kg, however, were strongly myelosuppressive. In vitro treatment of undifferentiated myelomonocytic leukemia cells from the WEHI-3B cell line with 10-1,000 micrograms/ml of poly(I,C)-LC resulted in a significant increase in CSF secretion by the leukemic cells and a concomitant inhibition of their proliferation. Incubation of cells from the WEHI-3B D+ subline, which differentiate in response to GM-CSF or G-CSF, with 50-100 micrograms/ml poly(I,C)-LC in agar cultures induced in approximately 45% of the leukemic colonies a differentiation into granulocytes and/or M phi. Poly(I,C)-LC, however, had no effect on differentiation of cells from the CSF unresponsive WEHI-3B D- subline. The CSF-inducing biological response modifier poly(I,C)-LC thus has the potential to stimulate growth and differentiation of normal, as well as differentiation of malignant myelopoietic progenitor cells.},

In vivo, the guide RNA gA6[14] is thought to specify the deletion of two uridines from the editing site closest to the 3' end. In this study, an in vitro system was developed that accurately removed uridines from this editing site in synthetic ATPase 6 pre-mRNA when gA6[14] and ATP were added. Mutations in both the guide RNA and the pre-mRNA editing site suggest that base-pairing interactions control the number of uridines deleted in vitro. Thus, guide RNAs are required for RNA editing and for the transfer of genetic information to pre-mRNAs.},

  abstract       = {In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, Skp1 is hydroxylated on proline 143 and further modified by three cytosolic glycosyltransferases to yield an O-linked pentasaccharide that contributes to O2 regulation of development. Skp1 is an adapter in the Skp1/cullin1/F-box protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that targets specific proteins for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. To investigate the biochemical consequences of glycosylation, untagged full-length Skp1 and several of its posttranslationally modified isoforms were expressed and purified to near homogeneity using recombinant and in vitro strategies. Interaction studies with the soluble mammalian F-box protein Fbs1/Fbg1/OCP1 revealed preferential binding to the glycosylated isoforms of Skp1. This difference correlated with the increased âÃ©Â¬Â±-helical and decreased âÃ©Â¬â¤-sheet content of glycosylated Skp1s based on circular dichroism and increased folding order based on small-angle X-ray scattering. A comparison of the molecular envelopes of fully glycosylated Skp1 and the apoprotein indicated that both isoforms exist as an antiparallel dimer that is more compact and extended in the glycosylated state. Analytical gel filtration and chemical cross-linking studies showed a growing tendency of less modified isoforms to dimerize. Considering that regions of free Skp1 are intrinsically disordered and Skp1 can adopt distinct folds when bound to F-box proteins, we propose that glycosylation, which occurs adjacent to the F-box binding site, influences the spectrum of energetically similar conformations that vary inversely in their propensity to dock with Fbs1 or another Skp1. Glycosylation may thus influence Skp1 function by modulating F-box protein binding in cells.},

  abstract       = {The 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5OAS) is a enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) in a dsRNA-dependent manner, and known as a major component of the IFN-induced host defense mechanisms against microbial infections. Here, we report the presence of a novel 2-5OAS-like molecule, termed Oasl5, in mice. The size of Oasl5 cDNA was about 2 kb and encoded a protein consisting of 362 aa. The amino acid sequence showed 76% similarity to the mouse 2-5OAS, however, several motifs being important for the enzyme activity were not conserved. The Oasl5 mRNA was most significantly expressed in the brain, and relatively weak expression was found in other organs such as the spleen, kidney, ovary and testis. It was also expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Oasl5 mRNA expression in ES cells was elevated 5-fold after treatment with IFN and about 2-fold in the brain when stimulated with IFN inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C]). In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Oasl5 is expressed in neurons in the central nervous system in adult mice. When Oasl5 was expressed in E. coli, it yielded 42 kDa protein that binds to dsRNA, but it did not show oligoadenylate synthetase activity. These findings suggest a novel function of Oasl5, which are independent of oligoadenylate synthetase activity, in the brain and developing embryos.},

  abstract       = {Large dsRNA molecules can cause potent cytotoxic and immunostimulatory effects through the activation of pattern recognition receptors; however, synthetic versions of these molecules are mostly limited to simple sequences like poly-I:C and poly-A:U. Here we show that large RNA molecules generated by rolling circle transcription fold into periodic-shRNA (p-shRNA) structures and cause potent cytotoxicity and gene silencing when delivered to cancer cells. We determined structural requirements for the dumbbell templates used to synthesize p-shRNA, and showed that these molecules likely adopt a co-transcriptionally folded structure. The cytotoxicity of p-shRNA was robustly observed across four different cancer cell lines using two different delivery systems. Despite having a considerably different folded structure than conventional dsRNA, the cytotoxicity of p-shRNA was either equal to or substantially greater than that of poly-I:C depending on the delivery vehicle. Furthermore, p-shRNA caused greater NF-âÃ©Â¬â«B activation in SKOV3 cells compared to poly-I:C, indicating that it is a powerful activator of innate immunity. The tuneable sequence and combined gene silencing, immunostimulatory and cytotoxic capacity of p-shRNA make it an attractive platform for cancer immunotherapy.},

  abstract       = {In the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing, miRNA-seq, to discover and explore the expression profiles of known and novel miRNAs in TLR ligand-stimulated vis-ââ -vis non-stimulated (i.e. Control) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from blood of healthy Murrah buffaloes. Six small RNA (sRNA) libraries were multiplexed in Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced on Ion Proton System. The reads obtained were aligned to the Bos taurus genome (UMD3.1 assembly), which is phylogenetically closest species to buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs were biocomputationally identified in buffalo PBMCs and 130 putatively novel miRNAs (not enlisted in the bovine mirBase) were identified. All of these 290 miRNAs identified across the six treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for the buffalo species. The expression profiles of these miRNAs across the samples have been represented by sample dendrogram and heatmap plots. The uniquely expressed miRNAs in each treatment and control groups were identified. A few miRNAs were expressed at very high levels while the majority of them were moderately expressed. The miRNAs bta-miR-103 and -191 were found to be highly abundant and expressed in all the samples. Other abundantly expressed miRNAs include bta-miR-19b, -29b, -15a, -19a, -30d, -30b-5p and members of let family (let 7a-5p, let 7g & let 7f) in LPS and CpG treated PBMCS and bta-miR-191, -103 & -19b in Poly I:C stimulated PBMCs. Only one novel miRNA (bta-miR-11039) out of 130 identified putatively novel miRNAs, was expressed in all the six samples and differentially expressed (>2- fold) miRNAs were identified. Six of the differentially expressed miRNAs across the groups (bta-miR-421, bta-let-7i, bta-miR-138, bta-miR-21-5p, bta-miR-222 and bta-miR-27b) were subsequently confirmed by TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for the roles in innate immunity and TLR signaling pathways. This maiden study on profiling and cataloguing of bubaline miRNAs expressed in TLR-ligand stimulated PBMCs will provide an important reference point for future studies on regulatory roles of miRNAs in immune system of buffaloes.},

  abstract       = {The purine nucleoside analogs fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and 2'-deoxycoformycin exhibit impressive activity in lymphoproliferative malignancies of adults and children. Their mechanism of action is not clear. Studies have suggested that their use is associated with significant myelosuppression, immunosuppression, and in some circumstances, increased infection with viral and opportunistic pathogens. Because interferons (IFNs) are known to have immunomodulatory activity as well as potent antiproliferative and antiviral activity, we examined whether the chemotherapeutic purine nucleoside analogs alter interferon-beta (IFN-B) gene expression in MG63 in human osteosarcoma cells. Northern blot analysis showed a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-B mRNA accumulation in response to a known inducer (Poly I-Poly C) all three purine analogs. Hybridization analysis also revealed that inhibition of IFN-beta mRNA accumulation by the purine analogs is not a result of decreased mRNA stability. Further analysis of gene expression by PCR differential display indicated that the effect of the purine analogs was restricted to only a limited number of inducible genes. The data suggest that these molecules alter the signaling process involved in regulating the expression of specific genes, including IFN-beta. These findings predict that the use of purine nucleoside analogs may reduce IFN production in vivo and thereby abrogate host defenses against infectious pathogens.},

  abstract       = {X-ray, phylogenetic and quantum chemical analysis of molecular interactions and conservation patterns of cis Watson-Crick (W.C.) A/G base-pairs in 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and other molecules was carried out. In these base-pairs, the A and G nucleotides interact with their W.C. edges with glycosidic bonds oriented cis relative to each other. The base-pair is stabilised by two hydrogen bonds, the C1'-C1' distance is enlarged and the G(N2) amino group is left unpaired. Quantum chemical calculations show that, in the absence of other interactions, the unpaired amino group is substantially non-planar due to its partial sp(3) pyramidalization, while the whole base-pair is internally propeller twisted and very flexible. The unique molecular properties of the cis W.C. A/G base-pairs make them distinct from other base-pairs. They occur mostly at the ends of canonical helices, where they serve as interfaces between the helix and other motifs. The cis W.C. A/G base-pairs play crucial roles in natural RNA structures with salient sequence conservation patterns. The key contribution to conservation is provided by the unpaired G(N2) amino group that is involved in a wide range of tertiary and neighbor contacts in the crystal structures. Many of them are oriented out of the plane of the guanine base and utilize the partial sp(3) pyramidalization of the G(N2). There is a lack of A/G to G/A covariation, which, except for the G(N2) position, would be entirely isosteric. On the contrary, there is a rather frequent occurrence of G/A to G/U covariation, as the G/U wobble base-pair has an unpaired amino group in the same position as the cis W.C. G/A base-pair. The cis W.C. A/G base-pairs are not conserved when there is no tertiary or neighbor interaction. Obtaining the proper picture of the interactions and phylogenetic patterns of the cis W.C. A/G base-pairs requires a detailed analysis of the relation between the molecular structures and the energetics of interactions at a level of single H-bonds and contacts.},

The results suggest that different human solid malignancies vary significantly in their sensitivity to Ampligen. Tumors with 50% or more of their surgical specimens showing sensitivity included carcinoid, glioblastoma, and carcinomas of the kidney, and lung. Resistant tumors (less than 15% sensitivity) included sarcomas and colo-rectal carcinomas. Overall, 42% of the tumor specimens studied showed a 50% or greater reduction in tumor cell colony formation after a single initial treatment with Ampligen (250 micrograms/ml). Interestingly, one patient's tumor which was de novo sensitive to interferon (IFN), but emerged as IFN-resistant following IFN therapy, remained sensitive to Ampligen. Thus, a clonogenic assay may prove useful in identifying human tumors and individuals for clinical trials with Ampligen, including patients resistant to IFN.},

  abstract       = {The understanding of how genetic information is stored and expressed has advanced considerably since the "central dogma" asserted that genetic information flows from the nucleotide sequence of DNA to that of messenger RNA (mRNA) which in turn specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein. It was found that genetic information can be stored as RNA (e.g. in RNA viruses) and can flow from RNA to DNA by reverse transcriptase enzyme activity. In addition, some genes contain introns, nucleotide sequences that are removed from their RNA (by RNA splicing) and thus are not represented in the resultant protein. Furthermore, alternative splicing was found to produce variant proteins from a single gene. More recently, the study of trypanosome parasites revealed an unexpected and indeed counter-intuitive genetic complexity. Genetic information for a single protein can be dispersed among several (DNA) genes in these organisms. One of these genes specifies an encrypted precursor mRNA that is converted to a functional mRNA by a process called RNA editing that inserts and deletes uridylate nucleotides. The sequence of the edited mRNA is specified by multiple small RNAs, named guide RNAs, (gRNAs) each of which is encoded in a separate gene. Thus, edited mRNA sequences are assembled from multiple genes by the transfer of information from one type of RNA to another. The existence of editing was surprising but has stimulated the discovery of other types of RNA editing. The Stuart laboratory has been exploring RNA editing in trypanosomes from the time of its discovery. They found dramatic differences between the mitochondrial gene sequences and those of the corresponding mRNAs, which indicated editing by the insertion and deletion of uridylates. Some editing was modest; simply eliminating shifts in sequence register of minimally extending the protein coding sequence. However, editing of many mRNAs was startingly extensive. The RNA sequence was essentially entirely remodeled with its sequence more the result of editing than the gene sequence. The identities of genes for such extensively edited RNA were not recognizable from the DNA sequence but they were readily identifiable from the edited mRNA sequence. Thus, despite the complex and extensive editing the resultant mRNA sequence is precise. Characterization of partially edited RNAs indicated that editing proceeds in the direction opposite to that used to specify the protein which reflects the use of the gRNAs. The numerous gRNAs that are used for editing are encoded in the DNA molecules whose role was previously a mystery. Using information gained in our earlier studies, the Stuart group developed an in vitro system that reproduces the fundamental process of editing in order to resolve the mechanism by which it occurs. They determined that editing entails a series of enzymatic steps rather than the mechanism used in RNA splicing. They also showed that chimeric gRNA-mRNA molecules are aberrant by-products of editing rather than intermediates in the process as had been proposed. Additional studies are exploring precisely how the number of added and deleted uridylates is specified by the gRNA. The Stuart laboratory showed that editing is performed by an aggregation of enzymes that catalyze the separate steps of editing. It also developed a method to purify this multimolecule complex that contains several, perhaps tens of, proteins. This will allow the study of its composition and the functions of its component parts. Indeed, the gene for one component has been identified and its detailed characterization begun. These studies are developing tools to explore related processes. An early finding in the lab was that the various mRNAs are differentially edited during the life cycle of the parasite. The pattern of this editing indicates that editing serves to regulate the alternation between two modes of energy generation. This regulation is coordinated with other events that are occurring during the life c},

  abstract       = {Dengue is a common arthropod-borne flaviviral infection in the tropics, for which there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drug. The infection is often associated with serious complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), in which both viral and host factors have been implicated. RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent antiviral strategy and a potential therapeutic option for dengue if a feasible strategy can be developed for delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, the major in vivo targets of the virus and also the source of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we show that a dendritic cell-targeting 12-mer peptide (DC3) fused to nona-D-arginine (9dR) residues (DC3-9dR) delivers siRNA and knocks down endogenous gene expression in heterogenous DC subsets, (monocyte-derived DCs [MDDCs], CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cell [HSC])-derived Langerhans DCs, and peripheral blood DCs). Moreover, DC3-9dR-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting a highly conserved sequence in the dengue virus envelope gene (siFvE(D)) effectively suppressed dengue virus replication in MDDCs and macrophages. In addition, DC-specific delivery of siRNA targeting the acute-phase cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which plays a major role in dengue pathogenesis, either alone or in combination with an antiviral siRNA, significantly reduced virus-induced production of the cytokine in MDDCs. Finally to validate the strategy in vivo, we tested the ability of the peptide to target human DCs in the NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgamma(-/-) mouse model engrafted with human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HuHSC mice). Treatment of mice by intravenous (i.v.) injection of DC3-9dR-complexed siRNA targeting TNF-alpha effectively suppressed poly(I:C)-induced TNF-alpha production by DCs. Thus, DC3-9dR can deliver siRNA to DCs both in vitro and in vivo, and this delivery approach holds promise as a therapeutic strategy to simultaneously suppress virus replication and curb virus-induced detrimental host immune responses in dengue infection.},

  abstract       = {Pituitary tumors are the most common type of cancer within the central nervous system. In the present study, the expression levels of mucin 1 (Muc1) were examined in invasive and nonâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²invasive pituitary tumor samples, and the results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis demonstrated marked positive expression of Muc1. In addition, Muc1 + polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) was found to stimulate the expression levels of the surface molecules cluster of differentiation (CD)40, CD83 and CD80, and HLAâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²DRm and decreased the expression of CD14 in the dendritic cells, determined using fluorescenceâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²activated cell sorting. The secretions of interleukin (IL)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²6, tumor necrosis factorâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬Â± and ILâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²1âÃ©Â¬â¤ cytokines were also significantly induced, in a doseâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²dependent manner. In in vivo experiments, a higher percentage of CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes was detected, and the levels of interferonâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¥ and ILâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²2 in the splenocytes were also upregulated. Furthermore, the combination treatment of Muc1 with poly I:C increased antiâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²Muc1 IgM and antiâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²Muc1 IgG titers, and altered the balance of IgG2a and IgG1, all of which increased the T helper (Th)1 polarized immune response. Thus, the tumor antigen, Muc1, with poly I:C may produce potent protective effects, which polarize immune responses towards Th1, and elicit antitumor immunity to inhibit the progression of pituitary tumors.},

  abstract       = {Human genetic trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs) are characterized by triplet repeat expansions, most frequently found as CNG-tracts in genome. At RNA level, such expansions suggestively result in formation of double-helical hairpins that become a potential source for small RNAs involved in RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we present three crystal structures of RNA fragments composed of triplet repeats CUG and CGG/CUG, as well as two crystal structures of same triplets in a protein-bound state. We show that both 20mer pG(CUG)(6)C and 19mer pGG(CGG)(3)(CUG)(2)CC form A-RNA duplexes, in which U.U or G.U mismatches are flanked/stabilized by two consecutive Watson-Crick G.C base pairs resulting in high-stacking GpC steps in every third position of the duplex. Despite interruption of this regularity in another 19mer, p(CGG)(3)C(CUG)(3), the oligonucleotide still forms regular double-helical structure, characterized, however, by 12 bp (rather than 11 bp) per turn. Analysis of newly determined molecular structures reveals the dynamic aspects of U.U and G.U mismatching within CNG-repetitive A-RNA and in a protein-bound state, as well as identifies an additional mode of U.U pairing essential for its dynamics and sheds the light on possible role of regularity of trinucleotide repeats for double-helical RNA structure. Findings are important for understanding the structural behavior of CNG-repetitive RNA double helices implicated in TREDs.},

  abstract       = {Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the United States. Prostate cancer therapy is severely hampered by lack of response and development of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in patients. Therefore, the development and discovery of new drugs have become an urgent clinical need. Interferons (IFNs), a family of pleiotropic cytokines, exert antitumor activities due to their anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory and proapoptotic functions. Here, we report that pretreatment of prostate cancer PC-3 cells with IFNs sensitized these cells to double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)-induced apoptosis. The enhancement effect of IFN treatment was dependent on IFN subtypes, in particular, IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥. In comparison with IFN âÃ©Â¬Â± or âÃ©Â¬â¤, IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥ treatment remarkably augmented apoptosis in PC-3 cells induced with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthesized form of dsRNA. We demonstrated that IFN-signaling was necessary for these effects by using mutant cell lines. Transfection of 2-5A, the activator of RNase L, or silencing of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) by siRNA did not have any significant impact on this event, suggesting that neither RNase L nor PKR was involved in poly I:C/IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥-induced apoptosis in the cells. Further investigation of the apoptotic pathway revealed that Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2family, was synergistically up-regulated by IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥ and poly I:C, whereas other members of the family were not affected. Knocking down of Bak demonstrated its contribution to poly I:C/IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥-induced apoptosis in the cells. We believeour findings will precipitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.},

  abstract       = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most contagious and economically important diseases of cloven-hoofed livestock. Currently used inactivated FMD vaccines have short lived immunity besides risk of handling live virus. We studied recombinant FMD virus like particles (VLPs) encoded by FMDV type O/IND/R2/75 polyprotein genes expressed in Sf9 cells and adjuvanted with CpG or Poly I:C in inducing protective immune response in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs immunized with VLP + CpG vaccine had shown markedly higher cell mediated immunity (CMI) in comparison to the conventional vaccine group as evident from higher levels of IgG2 than IgG1. Although the humoral response was less in VLP + CpG compared to conventional vaccine, the lymphocyte stimulation index was more in VLP + CpG compared to conventional and VLP + Poly I:C vaccine groups. Finally the challenge experiments on 28 and 56 dpv had shown 75% protection in VLP + CpG immunized guinea pigs primary and boosted animals, while 50% and 62% protection in VLP + Poly I:C in primary and boosted animals, respectively. In conclusion, CpG adjuvant was found to be superior followed by ISA206 and Poly I:C in eliciting protection in VLP based FMD vaccines in guinea pigs.},

Instead of adding a phase shift to the heavy-atom phases to obtain a starting value for the native protein phase, this phase shift is subtracted from the native phase to obtain the heavy-atom substructure phase. The required native phase is calculated from the information in a Protein Data Bank file of the structure. The resulting density enables even very weak anomalous scatterers such as sulfur to be located. Potential applications include the identification of unknown atoms and the validation of molecular replacement solutions.},

  abstract       = {Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is an important target for antiviral inhibitors since its active site is highly conserved such that inhibitors can be cross-reactive against multiple types and subtypes of influenza. Here, we discuss the crystal structure of neuraminidase subtype N9 complexed with a new benzoic acid based inhibitor (2) that was designed to add contacts by overpacking one side of the active site pocket. Inhibitor 2 uses benzoic acid to mimic the pyranose ring, a bis-(hydroxymethyl)-substituted 2-pyrrolidinone ring in place of the N-acetyl group of the sialic acid, and a branched aliphatic structure to fill the sialic acid C6 subsite.\\ Inhibitor 2 {4-[2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-oxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-3-[(dipropylamino)methyl)]benzoic acid} was soaked into crystals of neuraminidase of A/tern/Australia/G70c/75 (N9), and the structure refined with 1.55 âÃ X-ray data. The benzene ring of the inhibitor tilted 8.9Â¬â compared to the previous compound (1), and the number of contacts, including hydrogen bonds, increased. However, the IC50 for compound 2 remained in the low micromolar range, likely because one propyl group was disordered. In this high-resolution structure of NA isolated from virus grown in chicken eggs, we found electron density for additional sugar units on the N-linked glycans compared to previous neuraminidase structures. In particular, seven mannoses and two N-acetylglucosamines are visible in the glycan attached to Asn200. This long, branched high-mannose glycan makes significant contacts with the neighboring subunit.\\ We designed inhibitor 2 with an extended substituent at C4-corresponding to C6 of sialic acid-to increase the contact surface in the C6-subsite and to force the benzene ring to tilt to maximize these interactions while retaining the interactions of the carboxylate and the pyrolidinone substituents. The crystal structure at 1.55 âÃ showed that we partially succeeded in that the ring in 2 is tilted relative to 1 and the number of contacts increased, but one hydrophobic branch makes no contacts, perhaps explaining why the IC50 did not decrease. Future design efforts will include branches of unequal length so that both branches may be accommodated in the C6-subsite without conformational disorder. The high-mannose glycan attached to Asn200 makes several inter-subunit contacts and appears to stabilize the tetramer.},

  abstract       = {Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) studies in schizophrenia patients generally report decreased levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glutamate and glutathione, particularly in frontal cortex. However, these data are inconsistent in part due to confounds associated with clinical samples. The lack of validated diagnostic biomarkers also hampers analysis of the neurodevelopmental trajectory of neurochemical abnormalities. Rodent models are powerful tools to address these issues, particularly when combined with (1)H MRS (clinically comparable technology). We investigated the trajectory of metabolic changes in the prefrontal cortex during brain maturation from adolescence to adulthood in vivo using (1)H MRS in rats exposed prenatally to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (POL), a rodent model of maternal immune activation (MIA), an epidemiological risk factor for several psychiatric disorders with a neurodevelopmental origin. Longitudinal in vivo (1)H MRS revealed a significant decrease in PFC levels of GSH and taurine in adult, but not adolescent rats. Significant ageâÃ³MIA interactions for PFC levels of NAA were also observed. These data replicate some deficits observed in the PFC of patients with schizophrenia. There were no significant changes in the levels of glutamate or any other metabolite. These data suggest prenatal exposure to POL leads to subtle metabolic perturbations of the normal maturing PFC, which may be related to subsequent behavioural abnormalities. Further work is however required to examine any potential confound of shipping stress on the presumed imbalances in PFC metabolites in POL-exposed offspring. Testing the interactions between MIA with stress or genetic risk variants will also be an important advance.},

  abstract       = {Lymphocyte count is an important phenotypic metric that has been reported to be related to the individual antiviral capacity of pigs and other mammals. To date, aside from information regarding several genes and pathways, little is known about the mechanism by which gene expression affects variation in lymphocyte count. In this work, we investigated the lymphocyte count variation after poly I:C stimulation and compared the transcriptomes of pigs with large and small differences of lymphocyte counts before and after poly I:C stimulation. Pigs with large and small differences of lymphocyte counts were designated as extreme response (ER) and moderate response (MR) pigs respectively. Lymphocyte counts in all animals were observed to decline after poly I:C stimulation. Transcriptomic analysis identified 1121 transcripts (981 differentially expressed genes) in MR pigs and 1045 transcripts (904 differentially expressed genes) in ER pigs. We found that the majority of the differentially expressed genes were involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the innate immune response of ER pigs was more rapid than that of MR pigs. Results indicated that the activation of signaling pathways associated with cell death, cytotoxicity and apoptosis may contribute to the poly I:C-induced decrease of lymphocyte counts in the periphery. Moreover, the differential expression patterns of chemokines and FAS either totally or partially provided an interpretation for the different degrees of decrease in the lymphocyte counts between MR and ER pigs. Overall, our study will provide further understanding of the molecular basis for the antiviral capacity of pigs and other mammals.},

  abstract       = {Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are considered to be a promising cell source for regenerative medicine because of their unlimited capacity for self-renewal and differentiation. However, little is known about the innate immunity in ESCs and ESC-derived cells. We investigated the responses of mouse (m)ESCs to three types of live viruses as follows: La Crosse virus, West Nile virus, and Sendai virus. Our results demonstrated mESCs were susceptible to viral infection, but they were unable to express type I interferons (IFNâÃ©Â¬Â± and IFNâÃ©Â¬â¤, IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤), which differ from fibroblasts (10T1/2 cells) that robustly express IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤ upon viral infections. The failure of mESCs to express IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤ was further demonstrated by treatment with polyIC, a synthetic viral dsRNA analog that strongly induced IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤ in 10T1/2 cells. Although polyIC transiently inhibited the transcription of pluripotency markers, the stem cell morphology was not significantly affected. However, polyIC can induce dsRNA-activated protein kinase in mESCs, and this activation resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation. We conclude that the cytosolic receptor dsRNA-activated protein kinase is functional, but the mechanisms that mediate type I IFN expression are deficient in mESCs. This conclusion is further supported by the findings that the major viral RNA receptors are either expressed at very low levels (TLR3 and MDA5) or may not be active (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) in mESCs.},

  abstract       = {The stabilities and structures of a series of RNA octamers containing symmetric tandem mismatches were studied by UV melting and imino proton NMR. The free energy increments for tandem mismatch formation are found to depend upon both mismatch sequence and adjacent base pairs. The observed sequence dependence of tandem mismatch stability is UGGU > GUUG > GAAG > or = AGGA > UUUU > CAAC > or = CUUC approximately UCCU approximately CCCC approximately ACCA approximately AAAA, and the closing base pair dependence is 5'G3'C > 5'C3'G > 5'U3'A approximately 5'A3'U. These results differ from expectations based on models used in RNA folding algorithms and from the sequence dependence observed for folding of RNA hairpins. Imino proton NMR results indicate the sequence dependence is partially due to hydrogen bonding within mismatches.},

X-ray crystallography can utilize a low-resolution EM map for structure determination followed by phase extension to high resolution. Test studies have been conducted on five crystal structures of large molecular assemblies, in which EM maps are used as models for structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) using various standard MR packages such as AMoRe, MOLREP and Phaser. The results demonstrate that EM maps are viable models for molecular replacement. Possible difficulties in data analysis, such as the effects of the EM magnification error, and the effect of MR positional/rotational errors on phase extension are discussed.},

  abstract       = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be polarized into two distinct populations, MSC1 and MSC2, by activation of different Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR4-primed MSC1 expressed proinflammatory factors, whereas TLR3-primed MSC2 expressed suppressive factors. However, little is known about the function of TLRs on B lymphocyte-related immune modulation. In this study, we investigated the expression of B cell activating factor (BAFF), a member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily with notable stimulating activity on B cells, in human MSCs (hMSCs) and in murine MSCs (mMSCs) after activation of TLRs. BAFF was increasingly expressed in presence of TLR4 agonist (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), while TLR2 agonist (Zymosan) and TLR3-agonist (polyinocinic-polycytidykic acid, poly I:C) had no effect on BAFF expression. In addition, we demonstrated that signaling pathways of NF-âÃ©Â¬â«B, p38 MAPK, and JNK were involved in TLR4-primed BAFF expression. Our results suggested that TLR4 and downstream pathways in MSCs exert an important function in B lymphocyte-related immune regulation. Further defining a homogeneous population of MSCs should provide insight into MSC-based immune-modulating therapy.},

  abstract       = {Recognition of viral dsRNA by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) leads to induction of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, and innate antiviral response. Here we identified the RNA-binding protein Mex3B as a positive regulator of TLR3-mediated signaling by expression cloning screens. Cells from Mex3b(-/-) mice exhibited reduced production of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ in response to the dsRNA analog poly(I:C) but not infection with RNA viruses. Mex3b(-/-) mice injected with poly(I:C) was more resistant to poly(I:C)-induced death. Mex3B was associated with TLR3 in the endosomes. It bound to dsRNA and increased the dsRNA-binding activity of TLR3. Mex3B also promoted the proteolytic processing of TLR3, which is critical for its activation. Mutants of Mex3B lacking its RNA-binding activity inhibited TLR3-mediated IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ induction. These findings suggest that Mex3B acts as a coreceptor of TLR3 in innate antiviral response.},

  abstract       = {RNA silencing (also known as RNA interference) is a conserved biological response to double-stranded RNA that regulates gene expression, and has evolved in plants as a defence against viruses. The response is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which guide the sequence-specific degradation of cognate messenger RNAs. As a counter-defence, many viruses encode proteins that specifically inhibit the silencing machinery. The p19 protein from the tombusvirus is such a viral suppressor of RNA silencing and has been shown to bind specifically to siRNA. Here, we report the 1.85-A crystal structure of p19 bound to a 21-nucleotide siRNA, where the 19-base-pair RNA duplex is cradled within the concave face of a continuous eight-stranded beta-sheet, formed across the p19 homodimer interface. Direct and water-mediated intermolecular contacts are restricted to the backbone phosphates and sugar 2'-OH groups, consistent with sequence-independent p19-siRNA recognition. Two alpha-helical 'reading heads' project from opposite ends of the p19 homodimer and position pairs of tryptophans for stacking over the terminal base pairs, thereby measuring and bracketing both ends of the siRNA duplex. Our structure provides an illustration of siRNA sequestering by a viral protein.},

  abstract       = {Viral infections can disturb the functions of adipose tissue and results and thus result in metabolic diseases. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA, induces innate antiviral responses by mimicking viral infection through the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). Poly(I:C) also inhibits the differentiation of mouse preadipocytes, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. In this study, poly(I:C) inhibited preadipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, but not in a time-dependent manner. Endogenously transfected poly(I:C) severely impaired the adipogenesis of preadipocytes compared with exogenously added poly(I:C). Low concentration of tumor necrosis factor-âÃ©Â¬Â± (TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â±) could effectively inhibit the preadipocyte differentiation. The effect of exogenously added poly(I:C) on inhibition of differentiation was significantly diminished in the preadipocytes of TLR3 knockout mice. By contrast, endogenously transfected poly(I:C) still inhibited the differentiation of TLR3-deficient preaidpocytes. Hence, MDA5/RIG-I signaling was involved in the poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation. The effect of poly(I:C) stimulation, either through endogenous transfection or exogenous addition, on inhibition of differentiation was significantly diminished in the preadipocytes of TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â± knockout mice. These results confirmed the evidence that poly(I:C) inhibited the differentiation of mouse preadipocytes through PRR-mediated secretion of TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â±.Immunology and Cell Biology accepted article preview online, 17 June 2016. doi:10.1038/icb.2016.57.},

  abstract       = {Type III interferons (IFN-âÃ©Â¬Âªs) comprise a group of newly identified antiviral cytokines that are functionally similar to type I IFNs and elicit first-line antiviral responses. Recently, type III IFNs were identified in several species; however, little information is available about type III IFNs in ducks. We compared the expression of type III IFNs and their receptor in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs) and duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEFs) in response to influenza virus infection. The results showed that the expression of type III IFNs was upregulated in both DEFs and CEFs following infection with H1N1 influenza virus or treatment with poly (I:C), and expression levels were significantly higher in CEFs than in DEFs at each time point. The expression of the receptor for type III IFNs (IL-28RâÃ©Â¬Â±) was also upregulated following infection with H1N1 virus or treatment with poly (I:C) and was significantly higher in CEFs than in DEFs at each time point. The expression of the receptor for type III IFNs occurred from 8 hpi and remained at similar levels until 36 hpi in CEFs, but the expression level was elevated from 36 hpi in DEFs. These findings revealed the existence of distinct expression patterns for type III IFNs in chickens and ducks in response to influenza virus infection. The provided data are fundamentally useful in furthering our understanding of type III IFNs and innate antiviral responses in different species.},

  abstract       = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive candidates for clinical therapeutic applications. Recent studies indicate MSCs express active Toll-like receptors (TLRs), but their effect on MSCs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that, after treating human umbilical cord MSCs with various TLR ligands, only TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C), could significantly increase the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, poly(I:C) could enhance MSCs' anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Next, we focused on the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the process of poly(I:C) activating MSCs. Our experiments indicated that miR-143 expression was significantly decreased in MSCs with poly(I:C) treatment, and the expression level of miR-143 could regulate the effect of poly(I:C) on MSCs' immunosuppressive function. Subsequent results showed that the reporter genes with putative miR-143 binding sites from the transforming growth factor-âÃ©Â¬â¤-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and COX-2 3' untranslated regions were downregulated in the presence of miR-143. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of TAK1 and COX-2 in MSCs was also downregulated with miR-143 overexpression, suggesting that TAK1 and COX-2 are target genes of miR-143 in MSCs. Consistent with miR-143 overexpression, TAK1 interference also attenuated MSCs' immunosuppressive function enhanced by poly(I:C). Additionally, it was shown that TLR3-activated MSCs could improve survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, while miR-143 overexpression reduced the effectiveness of this therapy. These results proved that poly(I:C) improved the immunosuppressive abilities of MSCs, revealed the regulatory role of miRNAs in the process, and may provide an opportunity for potential novel therapies for sepsis.},

  abstract       = {The upstream site of cleavage of all group I self-splicing introns is identified by an absolutely conserved U.G base pair. Although a wobble C.A pair can substitute the U.G pair, all other combinations of nucleotides at this position abolish splicing, suggesting that it is an unusual RNA structure, rather than sequence, that is recognized by the catalytic intron core. RNA enzymes are metalloenzymes, and divalent metal ion binding may be an important requirement for splice site recognition and catalysis. The paramagnetic broadening of NMR resonances upon manganese binding at specific sites was used to probe the interaction between divalent metal ions and an oligonucleotide model of a group I intron ribozyme substrate. Unlike previous studies in which only imino proton resonances were monitored, we have used isotopically labelled RNA and a set of complete spectral assignments to identify the location of the divalent metal binding site with much greater detail than previously possible. Two independent metal binding sites were identified for this oligonucleotide. A first metal binding site is located in the major groove of the three consecutive G.C base pairs at the end of double helical stem. A second site is found in the major groove of the RNA double helix in the vicinity of the U.G base pair. These results suggest that metal ion coordination (or a metal bridge) and tertiary interactions identified biochemically, may be used by group I intron ribozymes for substrate recognition.},

In addition, the experimental and theoretical methods used to treat DNA hydration are discussed as they relate to the stability of Z-DNA .

  abstract       = {Mutant R96H is a classic temperature-sensitive mutant of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. It was in fact the first variant of the protein to be characterized structurally. Subsequently, it has been studied extensively by a variety of experimental and computational techniques, but the reasons for the loss of stability of the mutant protein remain controversial. In the crystallographic refinement of the mutant structure at 1.9 \AA resolution one of the bond angles at the site of substitution appeared to be distorted by about 11( degrees ), and it was suggested that this steric strain was one of the major factors in destabilizing the mutant. Different computationally-derived models of the mutant structure, however, did not show such distortion. To determine the geometry at the site of mutation more reliably, we have extended the resolution of the data and refined the wildtype (WT) and mutant structures to be better than 1.1 A resolution. The high-resolution refinement of the structure of R96H does not support the bond angle distortion seen in the 1.9 \AA structure determination. At the same time, it does confirm other manifestations of strain seen previously including an unusual rotameric state for His96 with distorted hydrogen bonding. The rotamer strain has been estimated as about 0.8 kcal/mol, which is about 25% of the overall reduction in stability of the mutant. Because of concern that contacts from a neighboring molecule in the crystal might influence the geometry at the site of mutation we also constructed and analyzed supplemental mutant structures in which this crystal contact was eliminated. High-resolution refinement shows that the crystal contacts have essentially no effect on the conformation of Arg96 in WT or on His96 in the R96H mutant.},

  abstract       = {\Gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase 1 (GGT1) is a cell surface, N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase that cleaves glutathione and other âÃ©Â¬â¥-glutamyl compounds. GGT1 expression is essential in cysteine homeostasis, and its induction has been implicated in the pathology of asthma, reperfusion injury, and cancer. In this study, we report four new crystal structures of human GGT1 (hGGT1) that show conformational changes within the active site as the enzyme progresses from the free enzyme to inhibitor-bound tetrahedral transition states and finally to the glutamate-bound structure prior to the release of this final product of the reaction. The structure of the apoenzyme shows flexibility within the active site. The serine-borate-bound hGGT1 crystal structure demonstrates that serine-borate occupies the active site of the enzyme, resulting in an enzyme-inhibitor complex that replicates the enzyme's tetrahedral intermediate/transition state. The structure of GGsTop-bound hGGT1 reveals its interactions with the enzyme and why neutral phosphonate diesters are more potent inhibitors than monoanionic phosphonates. These structures are the first structures for any eukaryotic GGT that include a molecule in the active site covalently bound to the catalytic Thr-381. The glutamate-bound structure shows the conformation of the enzyme prior to release of the final product and reveals novel information regarding the displacement of the main chain atoms that form the oxyanion hole and movement of the lid loop region when the active site is occupied. These data provide new insights into the mechanism of hGGT1-catalyzed reactions and will be invaluable in the development of new classes of hGGT1 inhibitors for therapeutic use.},

  abstract = {The holographic method for the recovery of the electron density of macromolecules is based on the expansion of the electron density into Gaussian basis functions. The technique makes consistent use of real- and reciprocal-space information to produce electron-density maps. It enforces positivity of the recovered electron density and makes effective use of previously known information about the electron density, such as knowledge of a solvent region or knowledge of a partial structure. In this paper, we summarize the theory underlying the holographic method, and describe how we extend the range of information that can be used by the method to include information from multiple-isomorphous-replacement (MIR) data, multiple-anomalous-dispersion (MAD) data and knowledge of non-crystallographic symmetry. The convergence properties and the limiting accuracy of the method are discussed. Its power for synthetic problems is demonstrated and the method is applied to experimentally measured MIR data from kinesin, a motor protein domain that has recently been solved. Appendix A gives a detailed description of the algorithms and the equations used in {\it EDEN}, the computer program that implements the holographic method.},

  abstract  = {Bayesian statistical methods have become widely used
                  for data analysis and modelling in recent years, and
                  the BUGS software has become the most popular software
                  for Bayesian analysis worldwide. Authored by the team
                  that originally developed this software, The BUGS Book
                  provides a practical introduction to this program and
                  its use. The text presents complete coverage of all
                  the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction,
                  missing data, model criticism, and prior
                  sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked
                  examples and a wide range of applications from various
                  disciplines. The book introduces regression models,
                  techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide
                  range of modelling issues before going into the vital
                  area of hierarchical models, one of the most common
                  applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with
                  essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in
                  complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model
                  comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative
                  priors, and thoughtful choice of prior
                  distributions---all those aspects of the ``art'' of
                  modelling that are easily overlooked in more
                  theoretical expositions. More pragmatic than
                  ideological, the authors systematically work through
                  the large range of ``tricks'' that reveal the real
                  power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with
                  missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction,
                  ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the
                  examples are biostatistical, but they do not require
                  domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range
                  of other application areas. Full code and data for
                  examples, exercises, and some solutions can be found
                  on the book's website.},

  annote    = {"Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was developed to generate a distribution of collections of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. A square grid containing possible sample points is a Latin square iff there is only one sample in each row and each column. A Latin hypercube is the generalisation of this concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions. When sampling a function of k variables, the range of each variable is divided into n equally probable intervals. n sample points are then drawn such that a Latin Hypercube is created. Latin Hypercube sampling generates more efficient estimates of desired parameters than simple Monte Carlo sampling. This program generates a Latin Hypercube Sample by creating random permutations of the first n integers in each of k columns and then transforming those integers into n sections of a standard uniform distribution. Random values are then sampled from within each of the n sections. Once the sample is generated, the uniform sample from a column can be transformed to any distribution by using the quantile functions, e.g. qnorm(). Different columns can have different distributions. S-optimality seeks to maximize the mean distance from each design point to all the other points in the design, so the points are as spread out as possible. This function uses the CP algorithm to generate an optimal design with respect to the S optimality criterion." See Stocki, R. (2005) A method to improve design reliability using optimal Latin hypercube sampling Computer Assisted Mechanics and Engineering Sciences 12, 87â105.},

  abstract = {Abstract \{NMR\} and \{SAXS\} (small-angle X-ray scattering)/WAXS (wide-angle X-ray scattering) are highly complementary approaches for the analysis of \{RNA\} structure in solution. Here we describe an efficient NMR SAXS/WAXS approach for structural investigation of multi-helical RNAs. We illustrate this approach by determining the overall fold of a 92-nt 3-helix junction from the U4/U6 di-snRNA. The U4/U6 di-snRNA is conserved in eukaryotes and is part of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that comprises a major subunit of the assembled spliceosome. Helical orientations can be determined by X-ray scattering data alone, but the addition of \{NMR\} \{RDC\} (residual dipolar coupling) restraints improves the structure models. \{RDCs\} were measured in two different external alignment media and also by magnetic susceptibility anisotropy. The resulting alignment tensors are collinear, which is a previously noted problem for nucleic acids. Including \{WAXS\} data in the calculations produces models with significantly better fits to the scattering data. In solution, the U4/U6 di-snRNA forms a 3-helix junction with a planar Y-shaped structure and has no detectable tertiary interactions. Single-molecule Forrster resonance energy transfer data support the observed topology. A comparison with the recently determined cryo-electron microscopy structure of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP illustrates how proteins scaffold the \{RNA\} and dramatically alter the geometry of the U4/U6 3-helix junction.},

  pages     = {375--387},
  annote    = {The crystallographic diffraction experiment measures Bragg intensities; crystallo­graphic electron-density maps and other crystallographic calculations in phasing require structure-factor amplitudes. If data were measured with no errors, the structure-factor amplitudes would be trivially proportional to the square roots of the intensities. When the experimental errors are large, and especially when random errors yield negative net intensities, the conversion of intensities and their error estimates into amplitudes and associated error estimates becomes nontrivial. Although this problem has been addressed intermittently in the history of crystallographic phasing, current approaches to accounting for experimental errors in macromolecular crystallography have numerous significant defects. These have been addressed with the formulation of LLGI, a log-likelihood-gain function in terms of the Bragg intensities and their associated experimental error estimates. LLGI has the correct asymptotic behaviour for data with large experimental error, appropriately downweighting these reflections without introducing bias. LLGI abrogates the need for the conversion of intensity data to amplitudes, which is usually performed with the French and Wilson method [French \& Wilson (1978[French, S. \& Wilson, K. (1978). Acta Cryst. A34, 517-525.]), Acta Cryst. A35, 517–525], wherever likelihood target functions are required. It has general applicability for a wide variety of algorithms in macromolecular crystallography, including scaling, characterizing anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry, detecting outliers, experimental phasing, molecular replacement and refinement. Because it is impossible to reliably recover the original intensity data from amplitudes, it is suggested that crystallographers should always deposit the intensity data in the Protein Data Bank.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:High-throughput bioinformatic analysis tools are needed
to mine the large amount of structural data via knowledge based approaches.
The development of such tools requires a robust interface to access
the structural data in an easy way. For this the Python scripting
language is the optimal choice since its philosophy is to write an
understandable source code.RESULTS:p3d is an object oriented Python
module that adds a simple yet powerful interface to the Python interpreter
to process and analyse three dimensional protein structure files
(PDB files). p3d's strength arises from the combination of a) very
fast spatial access to the structural data due to the implementation
of a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree, b) set theory and c) functions
that allow to combine a and b and that use human readable language
in the search queries rather than complex computer language. All
these factors combined facilitate the rapid development of bioinformatic
tools that can perform quick and complex analyses of protein structures.CONCLUSION:p3d
is the perfect tool to quickly develop tools for structural bioinformatics
using the Python scripting language.},

  abstract  = {A novel approach is presented for an a priori assessment of the ambiguity associated with spherically averaged single-particle scattering. The approach is of broad interest to the structural biology community, allowing the rapid and model-independent assessment of the inherent non-uniqueness of three-dimensional shape reconstruction from scattering experiments on solutions of biological macromolecules. One-dimensional scattering curves recorded from monodisperse systems are nowadays routinely utilized to generate low-resolution particle shapes, but the potential ambiguity of such reconstructions remains a major issue. At present, the (non)uniqueness can only be assessed by a posteriori comparison and averaging of repetitive Monte Carlo-based shape-determination runs. The new a priori ambiguity measure is based on the number of distinct shape categories compatible with a given data set. For this purpose, a comprehensive library of over 14,000 shape topologies has been generated containing up to seven beads closely packed on a hexagonal grid. The computed scattering curves rescaled to keep only the shape topology rather than the overall size information provide a `scattering map' of this set of shapes. For a given scattering data set, one rapidly obtains the number of neighbours in the map and the associated shape topologies such that in addition to providing a quantitative ambiguity measure the algorithm may also serve as an alternative shape-analysis tool. The approach has been validated in model calculations on geometrical bodies and its usefulness is further demonstrated on a number of experimental X-ray scattering data sets from proteins in solution. A quantitative ambiguity score (a-score) is introduced to provide immediate and convenient guidance to the user on the uniqueness of the ab initio shape reconstruction from the given data set.},

  abstract = {Introduction: X-ray crystallography provides the majority of our structural biological knowledge at a molecular level and, in terms of pharmaceutical design, is a valuable tool to accelerate discovery. It is the premier technique in the field, but its usefulness is significantly limited by the need to grow well-diffracting crystals. It is for this reason that high-throughput crystallization has become a key technology that has matured over the past 10 years through the field of structural genomics. Areas covered : The authors describe their experiences in high-throughput crystallization screening in the context of structural genomics and the general biomedical community. They focus on the lessons learnt from the operation of a high-throughput crystallization-screening laboratory, which to date has screened over 12,500 biological macromolecules. They also describe the approaches taken to maximize the success while minimizing the effort. Through this, the authors hope that the reader will gain an insight into the efficient design of a laboratory and protocols to accomplish high-throughput crystallization on a single-, multiuser laboratory or industrial scale. Expert opinion : High-throughput crystallization screening is readily available but, despite the power of the crystallographic technique, getting crystals is still not a solved problem. High-throughput approaches can help when used skillfully; however, they still require human input in the detailed analysis and interpretation of results to be more successful.},

As neutron sources are becoming more available to general users, finding means to optimize the growth of protein crystals to sizes suitable for NMC is extremely important. Historically, much has been learned about growing crystals for X-ray diffraction. However, owing to new-generation synchrotron X-ray facilities and sensitive detectors, protein crystal sizes as small as in the nano-range have become adequate for structure determination, lessening the necessity to grow large crystals. Here, some of the approaches, techniques and considerations for the growth of crystals to significant dimensions that are now relevant to NMC are revisited. These include experimental strategies utilizing solubility diagrams, ripening effects, classical crystallization techniques, microgravity and theoretical considerations.},

The conditions are later adjusted to the metastable zone by direct dilution. The added volume varied from 10 to 30% ofthe total drop volume immediately after dilution. Over 90% of the crystals from droplets set in the nucleation zone were useless for diffracton studies. In contrast, >60% of the crystals grown from the metastable zone yield diffraction quality crystals. In parallel experiments, they varied the time that the drop was in the nucleation zone (1,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,19,20,48 h). In general, shorter times led to fewer and larger crystals along with more clear drops. The reproducibility in determining the boundaries of the nucleation zone is limited by a number of experimental errors: the surfaces on which crystals growth, the action of bacteria in the drop, errors in pH of the buffer, temperature fluctuations, pipetting errors, errors in the concentration of the RNA, errors in the concentration of the chemical components, and so on.},

The authors argue that inclusion of the determination of the solubility curve to obtain a complete phase diagram takes a lot more material and time. The cost of the ignorance of the solubility curve is to transfer crystallization drops to reservoirs that support undersaturated conditions that yield no crystals rather than metastable conditions that support further crystal growth. Multiple experiments were done in duplicate and triplicate. The initial crystallization drop was placed over a solution containing 33\% to 83\% higher precipitant concentration. The idea was to induce nucleation just long enough to form a few crystal nuclei. The nucleation times tested for trypsin were 0, 2.5, 4.5, 6, 7, and 9 h. The times tested for C-phycocyanin were 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 7 h. They authors do not show the results by nucleation time. Instead, they just report examples of experimental parameter combinations that gave crystals that diffracted X-rays well. The controls consisted of drops below that supersolubility curve that were not incubated and that did not give crystals in 3 weeks. Some of these drops gave crystals after 6-8 weeks, probably due to evaporation from the chamber. A second set of controls consisted of leaving the drops over the conditions above the supersolubility curve. These controls usually gave clusters of crystals. In another set of experiments with C-phycoyanin and $\alpha$-crustacyanin, which were not described in the Materials and Methods, they investigated the effect of drop volume and reservoir to drop volume ratio. Drops volumes in the range of 2-6 uL gave similar results on a per unit drop volume ratio. In other words, there was not a decrease in the number of crystals per unit volume with larger drop volume. Reservoir to drop volume ratios below 67:1 gave larger numbers of smaller crystals and slowed down the time to appearance of the crystals. Higher ratios had no effect. Volumes under 300 uL did not cover the bottom of the well whereas larger volumes did do so. The surface area and surface tension of the well solution may have been the more important parameters than well volume per se. I conclude that you shoudl always use drops larger than 2 uL and reservoirs larger than 300 uL.},

Since the structural features of RNA are of major importance to their biological function, there is much interest in predicting RNA structure, either in free form or in interaction with various ligands, including proteins, metabolites and other molecules. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have developed novel RNA algorithms for predicting RNA secondary and tertiary structures. In this review, we describe current experimental and computational advances and discuss recent ideas that are transforming the traditional view of RNA folding. To evaluate the performance of the most recent RNA 3D folding algorithms, we provide a comparative study in order to test the performance of available 3D structure prediction algorithms for an RNA data set of 43 structures of various lengths and motifs. We find that the algorithms vary widely in terms of prediction quality across different RNA lengths and topologies; most predictions have very large root mean square deviations from the experimental structure. We conclude by outlining some suggestions for future RNA folding research.},

However, an important distinction must be made between parameter fitting and model selection. While parameter fitting simply determines how well a model fits the data, model selection statistics, such as the Bayesian evidence, are now necessary to choose between these different models, and in particular to assess the need for new parameters. We implement a new evidence algorithm known as nested sampling, which combines accuracy, generality of application, and computational feasibility, and we apply it to some cosmological data sets and models. We find that a five-parameter model with a Harrison-Zel'dovich initial spectrum is currently preferred.},

Without advance knowledge of the shape of the virus and only approximate knowledge of its size, the virus can be modeled as the symmetry expansion of a short list of nearly tetrahedrally arranged lattice points which coarsely, but uniformly, sample the icosahedrally unique volume. The number of lattice points depends on an estimate of the non-redundant information content at the working resolution limit. This parameterization permits a simple matrix formulation of the model evaluation calculation, resulting in a highly efficient survey of the space of possible models. Initially, one bit per parameter is sufficient, since the assignment of ones and zeros to the lattice points yields a physically reasonable low-resolution image of the virus. The best candidate solutions identified by the survey are refined to relax the constraints imposed by the coarseness of the modeling, and then trials whose intensity-based statistics are comparatively good in all resolution ranges are chosen. This yields an acceptable starting point for symmetry-based direct phase extension about half the time. Improving efficiency by incorporating the selection criterion directly into the genetic algorithm's fitness function is discussed.},

  abstract  = {Ab initio phasing by direct computational methods in low-resolution X-ray crystallography is a long-standing challenge. A common approach is to consider it as two subproblems: sampling of phase space and identification of the correct solution. While the former is amenable to a myriad of search algorithms, devising a reliable target function for the latter problem remains an open question. Here, recent developments in CrowdPhase, a collaborative online game powered by a genetic algorithm that evolves an initial population of individuals with random genetic make-up (i.e. random phases) each expressing a phenotype in the form of an electron-density map, are presented. Success relies on the ability of human players to visually evaluate the quality of these maps and, following a Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest concept, direct the search towards optimal solutions. While an initial study demonstrated the feasibility of the approach, some important crystallographic issues were overlooked for the sake of simplicity. To address these, the new CrowdPhase includes consideration of space-group symmetry, a method for handling missing amplitudes, the use of a map correlation coefficient as a quality metric and a solvent-flattening step. Performances of this installment are discussed for two low-resolution test cases based on bona fide diffraction data.},

This has lead to \emph{the natural selection of bad science}. The natural selection of bad science is driven by publication being the principle factor in career advancement. Some normative methods of data analysis are used to promote publication rather than advancement of understanding. This paper presents a meta-analysis of statistical power in 60-years of research in the behavorial sciences. They find that the selection for high output leads to poor methods and increasingly high rates of false discovery. The replication of results slows but does not stop the deterioration of methods.

  volume    = {9},
  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:
Traditional calculations of sample size do not formally incorporate uncertainty about the likely effect size. Use of a normal prior to express that uncertainty, as recently recommended, can lead to power that does not approach 1 as the sample size approaches infinity.
PURPOSE:
To provide approaches for calculating sample size and power that formally incorporate uncertainty about effect size. The relevant formulas should ensure that power approaches one as sample size increases indefinitely and should be easy to calculate.
METHODS:
We examine normal, truncated normal, and gamma priors for effect size computationally and demonstrate analytically an approach to approximating the power for a truncated normal prior. We also propose a simple compromise method that requires a moderately larger sample size than the one derived from the fixed effect method.
RESULTS:
Use of a realistic prior distribution instead of a fixed treatment effect is likely to increase the sample size required for a Phase 3 trial. The standard fixed effect method for moving from estimates of effect size obtained in a Phase 2 trial to the sample size of a Phase 3 trial ignores the variability inherent in the estimate from Phase 2. Truncated normal priors appear to require unrealistically large sample sizes while gamma priors appear to place too much probability on large effect sizes and therefore produce unrealistically high power.
LIMITATIONS:
The article deals with a few examples and a limited range of parameters. It does not deal explicitly with binary or time-to-failure data.
CONCLUSIONS:
Use of the standard fixed approach to sample size calculation often yields a sample size leading to lower power than desired. Other natural parametric priors lead either to unacceptably large sample sizes or to unrealistically high power. We recommend an approach that is a compromise between assuming a fixed effect size and assigning a normal prior to the effect size.},

The paper treats directly the issues of overdispersion and excess zeros that make count data too liberal. After eight pages of review, it compares several models with one example from health economics. Exploratory data analysis is done in before model fitting. Then the poisson regression, quasipoisson, negative binomial regression, hurdle regression, and zero-inflated regression are done one at a time. Finally, the models are compared. The modeled mean functions were similar, but the fitted likelihood is different. As a result, the models differ with respect to explaining overdispersion and the number of zero counts. The negative binomial model has the advantage of having a formal likelihood. As a result, information criteria are available and the expected number of zeros can be computed from the fitted density via $\sum_i f(0,\hat{\mu_i},\hat{\theta_i})$.},

  abstract  = {X-ray crystallography of biologically important RNA molecules has been hampered by technical challenges, including finding heavy-atom derivatives to obtain high-quality experimental phase information. Existing techniques have drawbacks, limiting the rate at which important new structures are solved. To address this, we have developed a reliable means to localize heavy atoms specifically to virtually any RNA. By solving the crystal structures of thirteen variants of the G*U wobble pair cation binding motif, we have identified a version that when inserted into an RNA helix introduces a high-occupancy cation binding site suitable for phasing. This "directed soaking" strategy can be integrated fully into existing RNA crystallography methods, potentially increasing the rate at which important structures are solved and facilitating routine solving of structures using Cu-Kalpha radiation. This method already has been used to solve several crystal structures.},

  abstract  = {Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a group of mathematical and statistical methods used for exploring the optimum operating conditions through statistical design of experiments. Obtaining the suitable analytical model between input variables and one or more responses is the main stage in RSM studies. When the response has replications, these replicated values may cause error. The proper modeling approach should be preferred according to the source of error, which is randomness or measurement error. In this study, Bayesian approach and fuzzy approach are used to estimate the model parameters in which the error becomes randomness and measurement error, respectively. The novelty of this study is analysis of response surface model parameters, which are obtained by using Bayesian approach and fuzzy approach, through interval analysis. The interpretation of model parameters and the comparison of modeling approaches are evaluated by interval arithmetic metrics. The suggested approaches are applied on replicated response measured two data sets and the results are discussed.

  abstract  = {The majority of macromolecular crystal structures are determined
using the method of molecular replacement, in which known
related structures are rotated and translated to provide an initial
atomic model for the new structure. A theoretical understanding
of the signal-to-noise ratio in likelihood-based molecular replacement
searches has been developed to account for the influence of
model quality and completeness, as well as the resolution of the
diffraction data. Here we show that, contrary to current belief,
molecular replacement need not be restricted to the use of models
comprising a substantial fraction of the unknown structure. Instead,
likelihood-based methods allow a continuum of applications
depending predictably on the quality of the model and the
resolution of the data. Unexpectedly, our understanding of the
signal-to-noise ratio in molecular replacement leads to the finding
that, with data to sufficiently high resolution, fragments as small
as single atoms of elements usually found in proteins can yield ab
initio solutions of macromolecular structures, including some that
elude traditional direct metods.},

  abstract  = {Here, a case is presented of an unusual structure determination which was facilitated by the use of pseudosymmetry. Group A streptococcus uses cysteine protease Mac-1 (also known as IdeS) to evade the host immune system. Native Mac-1 was crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P21212. Surprisingly, crystals of the inactive C94A mutant of Mac-1 displayed monoclinic symmetry with space group P21, despite the use of native orthorhombic Mac-1 micro- crystals for seeding. Attempts to solve the structure of the C94A mutant by MAD phasing in the monoclinic space group did not produce an interpretable map. The native Patterson map of the C94A mutant showed two strong peaks along the (1 0 1) diagonal, indicating possible translational pseudosymmetry in space group P21. Interestingly, one-third of the monoclinic reflections obeyed pseudo-orthorhombic P21212 symmetry similar to that of the wild-type crystals and could be indexed and processed in this space group. The pseudo- orthorhombic and monoclinic unit cells were related by the following vector operations: am = bo 􏰀 co, bm = ao and cm = 􏰀2co 􏰀 bo. The pseudo-orthorhombic subset of data produced good SAD phases, leading to structure determination with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Subsequently, the structure of the Mac-1 mutant in the monoclinic form was determined by molecular replacement, which showed six molecules forming three translationally related dimers aligned along the (1 0 1) diagonal. Knowing the geometric relationship between the pseudo-orthorhombic and the monoclinic unit cells, all six molecules can be generated in the monoclinic unit cell directly without the use of molecular replacement. The current case provides a successful example of the use of pseudosymmetry as a powerful phase-averaging method for structure determination by anomalous diffraction techniques. In particular, a structure can be solved in a higher pseudosymmetry subcell in which an NCS operator becomes a crystallographic operator. The geometrical relationships between the subcell and parental cell can be used to generate a complete molecular representation of the parental asymmetric unit for refinement.},

They had to develop some unique algorithms that make Stan useful for other kinds of computation outsdie of Bayeisan inference. The article then walks through a simple Bernoulli example with count data. This is the first turn of the learning spiral. Their discussion includes an analysis of the the output from the sampler, posterior mode estimates, and diagnosis of the log probability and gradient calculations. Then the article reviews the Stan modeling language and how compiled models are executed. They first cover a hierachical bionmial model with posterior inferences. The discussion includes what to do with non-centered parameterizations. One probably want to compare non-centered parameters and parameterized models on their own. Betacourt and Girolami (2013) found that non-centered models are best when the dat are sparse and centered are best whne the dta stronly identifies the coefficients. Next, data types in Stan are reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of Stan syntax in terms of expressions and type inference. Next, two kinds of statements are distinguished. This is followed by a presentation of the function and distribution library. Next, the HMC and HM samplers are presented along with three optimizers: BFGS, congugate gradient, and accelerated gradient. Next, random number generators are discussed. Stan is dependent on two external libraries: Boost and Eigen. Finally, the developer process is reviewed. This consists of version control on GitHub, continuous integration, testing framework, and build. Figures 6-14 are tables of parameters in Stan.},

  abstract  = {A simple relation exists between the packing density in crystals of short A-DNA duplexes and their global double-helical structure. The volume per nucleotide pair shows a linear inverse correlation with the mean displacement of base pairs from the best straight helix axis. The mean displacement is a measure of major groove depth and varies between -3.3 A and -4.9 A in A-form oligonucleotides analysed in the crystalline state. Since the mean displacement of base pairs from the helix axis determines other helical parameters such as base-pair longitudinal slide, its correlation with crystal packing is of considerable interest. The displacement-packing correlation is very clear for octamer duplexes which crystallize in three different lattices. Longer A-helical fragments sometimes deviate from the rule. It may be speculated whether A-form duplexes not completing a full helical turn are especially prone to distortions due to packing in crystals or arising from intermolecular contacts in solution.},

This book is an absolute treasure for anyone using Generalized LMs for research or work. Hardin lays out the details behind the development and application of GLMs and their extensions in a clear and straightforward way. The book does require prior knowledge of regression and familiarity with concepts such as matrix algebra, integrals and derivatives. It balances the theory, application and Stata programming beautifully! Understanding the family and link functions is absolutely necessary when building GLMs. The explanations are very clear.

  abstract = {Overdispersed count data are very common in ecology. The negative binomial model has been used widely to represent such data. Ecological data often vary considerably, and traditional approaches are likely to be inefficient or incorrect due to underestimation of uncertainty and poor predictive power. We propose a new statistical model to account for excessive overdisperson. It is the combination of two negative binomial models, where the first determines the number of clusters and the second the number of individuals in each cluster. Simulations show that this model often performs better than the negative binomial model. This model also fitted catch and effort data for southern bluefin tuna better than other models according to AIC. A model that explicitly and properly accounts for overdispersion should contribute to robust management and conservation for wildlife and plants.},

This review examines the role of X-ray crystallography in providing the required structural information and advances in the field of X-ray crystallography that enhance or expand its role. Main methods: X-ray crystallography of new drugs candidates and intermediates can provide valuable information of new syntheses and parameters for quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR). Key findings: Crystallographic studies play a vital role in many disciplines including materials science, chemistry, pharmacology, and molecular biology. X-ray crystallography is the most comprehensive technique available to determine molecular structure. A requirement for the high accuracy of crystallographic structures is that a ‘good crystal’ must be found, and this is often the rate-limiting step. In the past three decades developments in detectors, increases in computer power, and powerful graphics capabilities have contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of materials characterized by X-ray crystallography. More recently the advent of high-throughput crystallization techniques has enhanced our ability to produce that one good crystal required for crystallographic analysis. Significance: Continuing advances in all phases of a crystallographic study have expanded the ranges of samples which can be analyzes by X-ray crystallography to include larger molecules, smaller or weakly diffracting crystals, and twinned crystals.},

Learning their structure and intricacies is fraught with challenges, and often side-stepped in favour of studying the function of different gene products in isolation from their physiological context. Constructing and inferring global mathematical models from experimental data is, however, central to systems biology. Different experimental setups provide different insights into such systems. Here we show how we can combine concepts from Bayesian inference and information theory in order to identify experiments that maximize the information content of the resulting data. This approach allows us to incorporate preliminary information; it is global and not constrained to some local neighbourhood in parameter space and it readily yields information on parameter robustness and confidence. Here we develop the theoretical framework and apply it to a range of exemplary problems that highlight how we can improve experimental investigations into the structure and dynamics of biological systems and their behavior.},

  abstract  = {Protein solubility is a key parameter affecting the performance of every biotechnological downstream processing operation. Current methods used to determine protein solubility data, however, are often characterized by the need of pure protein crystals and long experimental time frames lying in the range of weeks to months, while other methods often fail to reach the solubility limits due to a too high dilution during the generation of the respective experimental solutions. This article presents an efficient, high throughput compatible methodâbased on photometric turbidity measurementsâwhich allows a gentle and controlled concentration of the solution while constantly analyzing the solution state. All experimental tools were developed using the robotic liquid handling station Tecan Freedom Evo 200. The ability to combine sample concentration and solution state analysis acts as a basis for the determination of process relevant solubility phase diagrams and analysis of relevant kinetic effects during precipitation. Effects of several buffers on protein solubility and solubility curves of different insulin variants are shown as examples of relevant screening parameters.},

The standard confidence regions for the stationary point are due to Box \& Hunter (1954). The authors propose an alternative parametrization, in which the stationary point is the parameter of interest; likelihood techniques and Bayesian analysis are then easier to perform. The authors also suggest an approximate method to get highest posterior density regions for the maximum point (not simply for the stationary point). Furthermore, they study the coverage probabilities of these Bayesian regions through simulations.''},

The major contribution of this paper is the fact that it provides a novel optimization scheme integrating a loss function approach with a posterior predictive approach in a single framework of Bayesian modeling and optimization. The proposed approach not only considers the correlation among multiple responses and the uncertainty of model parameters, but also takes into account quality loss (bias and robustness) and reliability of the optimization results. The illustrative example also shows that the proposed approach can give more reasonable results than the existing approaches when both quality loss and reliability of optimization results are important issues. In addition, the Bayesian optimization approach using Monte Carlo simulation and hybrid genetic algorithm can quickly calculate the quality loss and posterior probability of the optimal parameter setting, which is also applicable to other multi-response optimization problems. It should be noted that the proposed optimization strategy is also applicable to other operational research optimization problems such as stochastic stock problem and supply chain optimization problem.},

Here a convenient screening strategy is studied in detail that varies the volume ratio of protein sample to the reservoir solution in the drop to initiate crystallization that is named "composition modification". It is applied after the first screen and has been studied with twelve proteins. Statistical analysis shows a significant improvement in screening using this strategy. The average improvement of "hits" at different temperatures is between 32 and 42%, for examples, 41.8% ± 14.0% and 35.7% ± 12.4% (± standard deviation) at 288 K and 300 K, respectively. Remarkably, some new crystals were found by composition modification which increased the probability of reaching the nucleation zone to initiate crystallization. This was confirmed by a phase diagram study. It is also demonstrated that composition modification can further increase crystallisation success significantly (1.3 times) after the improvement of "hits" by temperature screening. The trajectories of different composition modifications during vapour diffusion were plotted, further demonstrating that protein crystallizability can be increased by hitting more parts of the nucleation zone. It was also found to facilitate the finding of initial crystals for proteins of low solubility. These proteins gradually become more concentrated during the vapour diffusion process starting from a larger protein solution ratio in the initial mixture.},

Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques useful for the modeling and analysis of problems. By careful design of experiments, the objective is to optimize a response (output variable) which is influenced by several independent variables (input variables). An experiment is a series of tests, called runs, in which changes are made in the input variables in order to identify the reasons for changes in the output response. It is the process of identifying and fitting an approximate response surface model from input and output data obtained from experimental studies or from the numerical analysis where each run can be regarded as an experiment.},

Once a list of potential factors is identified from subject‐matter expertise, the strengths of the associations between those factors and the target attributes need to be quantified. A naïve, one‐factor‐at‐a‐time analysis would require many more trials than necessary. Additionally, it would not yield information about whether the relationship between a factor and the target depends on the values of other factors (commonly referred to as interaction effects between factors). As demonstrated in Douglas Montgomery’s Design and Analysis of Experiments textbook, principles of statistical theory, linear algebra, and analysis guide the development of efficient experimental designs for factor settings. Once a subset of important factors has been isolated, subsequent experimentation can determine the settings of those factors that will optimize the target quality attributes. Fortunately, modern software has taken advantage of the advanced theory. This software now facilitates the development of good design and makes solid analysis more accessible to those with a minimal statistical background.},

  author    = {Huang, Kai-Zhu and Yang, Haiqin and Lyu, Michael R},
  annote    = {The objective of this book is to establish a framework which combines two different paradigms in machine learning: global learning and local learning. The combined model demonstrates that a hybrid learning of these two different schools of approaches can outperform each isolated approach both theoretically and empirically. Global learning focuses on describing a phenomenon or modeling data in a global way. For example, a distribution over the variables is usually estimated for summarizing the data. Its output can usually reconstruct the data. This school of approaches, including Bayesian Networks [8, 13, 30], Gaussian Mixture Models [3, 21], and Hidden Markov Models [2, 25], has a long and distinguished history, which has been extensively applied in artificial intelligence [26], pattern recognition [9], and computer vision [7]. On the other hand, local learning does not intend to summarize a phenomenon, but builds learning systems by concentrating on some local parts of data. It lacks the flexibility yet surprisingly demonstrates superior performance to global learning according to recent researches [4, 16, 15]. In this book, a bridge has been established between these two different paradigms. Moreover, the resulting principled framework subsumes several important models, which respectively locate themselves into the global learning paradigm and the local learning paradigm.},

  abstract  = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but as shown in this paper, the results can be sensitive to the prior choice for the global shrinkage hyperparameter. We argue that the previous default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector, and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model. The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly – in terms of improved parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time – from transforming even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the global parameter using our framework.},

  abstract      = {Models for the latest stages of the cosmological evolution rely on a less solid theoretical and observational ground than the description of earlier stages like BBN and recombination. As suggested in a previous work by Vonlanthen et al., it is possible to tweak the analysis of CMB data in such way to avoid making assumptions on the late evolution, and obtain robust constraints on ''early cosmology parameters''. We extend this method in order to marginalise the results over CMB lensing contamination, and present updated results based on recent CMB data. Our constraints on the minimal early cosmology model are weaker than in a standard ΛCDM analysis, but do not conflict with this model. Besides, we obtain conservative bounds on the effective neutrino number and neutrino mass, showing no hints for extra relativistic degrees of freedom, and proving in a robust way that neutrinos experienced their non-relativistic transition after the time of photon decoupling. This analysis is also an occasion to describe the main features of the new parameter inference code MONTE PYTHON, that we release together with this paper. MONTE PYTHON is a user-friendly alternative to other public codes like COSMOMC, interfaced with the Boltzmann code CLASS.},

However, their computer-intensive nature, which typically require a large number of iterations and a complete scan of the full dataset for each iteration, precludes their use for big data analysis. In this paper, we propose the so-called bootstrap Metropolis-Hastings (BMH) algorithm, which provides a general framework for how to tame powerful MCMC methods to be used for big data analysis; that is to replace the full data log-likelihood by a Monte Carlo average of the log-likelihoods that are calculated in parallel from multiple bootstrap samples. The BMH algorithm possesses an embarrassingly parallel structure and avoids repeated scans of the full dataset in iterations, and is thus feasible for big data problems. Compared to the popular divide-and-combine method, BMH can be generally more efficient as it can asymptotically integrate the whole data information into a single simulation run. The BMH algorithm is very flexible. Like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, it can serve as a basic building block for developing advanced MCMC algorithms that are feasible for big data problems. This is illustrated in the paper by the tempering BMH algorithm, which can be viewed as a combination of parallel tempering and the BMH algorithm. BMH can also be used for model selection and optimization by combining with reversible jump MCMC and simulated annealing, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Multistage sampling is often employed in survey samples for cost and convenience. However, accounting for clustering features when generating datasets for multiple imputation is a nontrivial task, particularly when, as is often the case, cluster sampling is accompanied by unequal probabilities of selection, necessitating case weights. Thus, multiple imputation often ignores complex sample designs and assumes simple random sampling when generating imputations, even though failing to account for complex sample design features is known to yield biased estimates and confidence intervals that have incorrect nominal coverage. In this article, we extend a recently developed, weighted, finite-population Bayesian bootstrap procedure to generate synthetic populations conditional on complex sample design data that can be treated as simple random samples at the imputation stage, obviating the need to directly model design features for imputation. We develop two forms of this method: one where the probabilities of selection are known at the first and second stages of the design, and the other, more common in public use files, where only the final weight based on the product of the two probabilities is known. We show that this method has advantages in terms of bias, mean square error, and coverage properties over methods where sample designs are ignored, with little loss in efficiency, even when compared with correct fully parametric models. An application is made using the National Automotive Sampling System Crashworthiness Data System, a multistage, unequal probability sample of U.S. passenger vehicle crashes, which suffers from a substantial amount of missing data in "Delta-V," a key crash severity measure.},

  abstract        = {Assessing the robustness of an inferred phylogeny is an important element of phylogenetics. This is typically done with measures of stabilities at the internal branches and the variation of the positions of the leaf nodes. The bootstrap support for branches in maximum parsimony, distance and maximum likelihood estimation, or posterior probabilities in Bayesian inference, measure the uncertainty about a branch due to the sampling of the sites from genes or sampling genes from genomes. However, these measures do not reveal how taxon sampling affects branch support and the effects of taxon sampling on the estimated phylogeny. An internal branch in a phylogenetic tree can be viewed as a split that separates the taxa into two nonempty complementary subsets. We develop several split-specific measures of stability determined from bootstrap support for quartets. These include BPtaxon_split (average bootstrap percentage [BP] for all quartets involving a taxon within a split), BPsplit (BPtaxon_split averaged over taxa), BPtaxon (BPtaxon_split averaged over splits) and RBIC-taxon (average BP over all splits after removing a taxon). We also develop a pruned-tree distance metric. Application of our measures to empirical and simulated data illustrate that existing measures of overall stability can fail to detect taxa that are the primary source of a split-specific instability. Moreover, we show that the use of many reduced sets of quartets is important in being able to detect the influence of joint sets of taxa rather than individual taxa. These new measures are valuable diagnostic tools to guide taxon sampling in phylogenetic experimental design.},

Nevertheless, computation time burden limits the application of methods such as maximum likelihood nonparametric bootstrap to assess reliability of evolutionary trees. As an alternative, the much faster Bayesian inference of phylogeny, which expresses branch support as posterior probabilities, has been introduced. However, marked discrepancies exist between nonparametric bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior probabilities, leading to difficulties in the interpretation of sometimes strongly conflicting results. As an attempt to reconcile these two indices of node reliability, we apply the nonparametric bootstrap resampling procedure to the Bayesian approach. The correlation between posterior probabilities, bootstrap maximum likelihood percentages, and bootstrapped posterior probabilities was studied for eight highly diverse empirical data sets and were also investigated using experimental simulation. Our results show that the relation between posterior probabilities and bootstrapped maximum likelihood percentages is highly variable but that very strong correlations always exist when Bayesian node support is estimated on bootstrapped character matrices. Moreover, simulations corroborate empirical observations in suggesting that, being more conservative, the bootstrap approach might be less prone to strongly supporting a false phylogenetic hypothesis. Thus, apparent conflicts in topology recovered by the Bayesian approach were reduced after bootstrapping. Both posterior probabilities and bootstrap supports are of great interest to phylogeny as potential upper and lower bounds of node reliability, but they are surely not interchangeable and cannot be directly compared.},

With this in mind, it is important to know something about how robust Bayesian methods are to the violation of those assumptions. In this paper, we focus on the problem of contaminated data (such as data with outliers or conflicts present), with specific application to the problem of estimating a credible interval for the population mean. We evaluate five Bayesian methods for constructing a credible interval, using toy examples to illustrate the qualitative behavior of different approaches in the presence of contaminants, and an extensive simulation study to quantify the robustness of each method. We find that the "default" normal model used in most Bayesian data analyses is not robust, and that approaches based on the Bayesian bootstrap are only robust in limited circumstances. A simple parametric model based on Tukey's "contaminated normal model" and a model based on the t-distribution were markedly more robust. However, the contaminated normal model had the added benefit of estimating which data points were discounted as outliers and which were not.},

Consequently, the standard bootstrap underpredicts average performance when used in the context of evaluating sequence comparison methods. We have developed, as an alternative, an unbiased statistical evaluation based on the Bayesian bootstrap, a resampling method operationally similar to the standard bootstrap.

This paper outlines a strategy for using an ABB to multiply impute nonignorable missing data. The method allows the user to draw inferences and perform sensitivity analyses when the missing data mechanism cannot automatically be assumed to be ignorable. Results from imputing missing values in a longitudinal depression treatment trial as well as a simulation study are presented to demonstrate the method's performance. We show that a procedure that uses a different type of ABB for each imputed data set accounts for appropriate uncertainty and provides nominal coverage.},

Many parametric and semiparametric estimation methods have been proposed for estimating the ROC curve and its functionals. In this paper, we propose the Bayesian bootstrap (BB), a fully nonparametric estimation method, for the ROC curve and its functionals, such as the area under the curve (AUC). The BB method offers a bandwidth-free smoothing approach to the empirical estimate, and gives credible bounds. The accuracy of the estimate of the ROC curve in the simulation studies is examined by the integrated absolute error. In comparison with other existing curve estimation methods, the BB method performs well in terms of accuracy, robustness and simplicity. We also propose a procedure based on the BB approach to test the binormality assumption.},

This effort has focused primarily on statistical significance testing and obtaining point estimates of parameters that contribute to interaction strength magnitudes, leaving the characterization of uncertainty associated with those estimates unconsidered. We consider a means of characterizing the uncertainty of a generalist predator's interaction strengths by formulating an observational method for estimating a predator's prey-specific per capita attack rates as a Bayesian statistical model. This formulation permits the explicit incorporation of multiple sources of uncertainty. A key insight is the informative nature of several so-called non-informative priors that have been used in modeling the sparse data typical of predator feeding surveys. We introduce to ecology a new neutral prior and provide evidence for its superior performance. We use a case study to consider the attack rates in a New Zealand intertidal whelk predator, and we illustrate not only that Bayesian point estimates can be made to correspond with those obtained by frequentist approaches, but also that estimation uncertainty as described by 95% intervals is more useful and biologically realistic using the Bayesian method. In particular, unlike in bootstrap confidence intervals, the lower bounds of the Bayesian posterior intervals for attack rates do not include zero when a predator-prey interaction is in fact observed. We conclude that the Bayesian framework provides a straightforward, probabilistic characterization of interaction strength uncertainty, enabling future considerations of both the deterministic and stochastic drivers of interaction strength and their impact on food webs.},

As Bayesian approaches may induce very different estimations, it is useful to consider the stability of the estimations as a criterion for evaluating the quality of the results. Cancer incidence data, from the Isere cancer registry (France) over the 1985-1994 period, have been used to check the proposed method: the study is based on 22 cancer sites among males and 24 among females. A bootstrap approach has been retained to evaluate the stability of the estimations. The coefficient of variation was chosen as an indicator of stability. Three Bayesian models corresponding to global, local and combined smoothing techniques, have been considered. The stability analysis has taken account of the results of spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity tests. Bayesian approaches do not necessarily lead to stable estimations. The local smoothing approach induces estimations that are often unstable. The global smoothing approach is the most stable, but is conservative. Combined smoothing appears to be a good compromise if significant spatial variations and heterogeneity of relative risks exist. Bayesian estimations of relative risks may be very unstable. However, when results of spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity tests are taken into account to choose between the different Bayesian approaches, instability becomes negligible.},

The main objective was to compare predictions of breeding values of complex traits using a combined training population with haplotype blocks, with predictions using a single breed as training population and individual SNP as predictors. To compare the prediction reliabilities, bootstrap samples were taken from the test data set. With the bootstrapped samples of prediction reliabilities, we built and graphed confidence ellipses to allow comparisons. Finally, measures of statistical distances were used to calculate the gain in predictive ability. Our analyses are innovative in the context of assessment of predictive models, allowing a better understanding of prediction reliabilities and providing a statistical basis to effectively calibrate whether one prediction scenario is indeed more accurate than another. An ANOVA indicated that use of haplotype blocks produced significant gains mainly when Bayesian mixture models were used but not when Bayesian BLUP was fitted to the data. Furthermore, when haplotype blocks were used to train prediction models in a combined Nordic Red cattle population, we obtained up to a statistically significant 5.5% average gain in prediction accuracy, over predictions using individual SNP and training the model with a single breed.},

  abstract        = {To detect positive selection at individual amino acid sites, most methods use an empirical Bayes approach. After parameters of a Markov process of codon evolution are estimated via maximum likelihood, they are passed to Bayes formula to compute the posterior probability that a site evolved under positive selection. A difficulty with this approach is that parameter estimates with large errors can negatively impact Bayesian classification. By assigning priors to some parameters, Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) mitigates this problem. However, as implemented, it imposes uniform priors, which causes it to be overly conservative in some cases. When standard regularity conditions are not met and parameter estimates are unstable, inference, even under BEB, can be negatively impacted. We present an alternative to BEB called smoothed bootstrap aggregation (SBA), which bootstraps site patterns from an alignment of protein coding DNA sequences to accommodate the uncertainty in the parameter estimates. We show that deriving the correction for parameter uncertainty from the data in hand, in combination with kernel smoothing techniques, improves site specific inference of positive selection. We compare BEB to SBA by simulation and real data analysis. Simulation results show that SBA balances accuracy and power at least as well as BEB, and when parameter estimates are unstable, the performance gap between BEB and SBA can widen in favor of SBA. SBA is applicable to a wide variety of other inference problems in molecular evolution.},

The method is illustrated with a simple example, the liquid drop model of nuclear binding energies. We find that the FDB gives a more conservative estimate of the uncertainty in liquid drop parameters than the χ^{2} method, and is in fair accord with more empirical estimates.

Despite the growing use of posterior probabilities, the relationship between the Bayesian measure of confidence and the most commonly used confidence measure in phylogenetics, the nonparametric bootstrap proportion, is poorly understood. We used computer simulation to investigate the behavior of three phylogenetic confidence methods: Bayesian posterior probabilities calculated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC-PP), maximum likelihood bootstrap proportion (ML-BP), and maximum parsimony bootstrap proportion (MP-BP). We simulated the evolution of DNA sequence on 17-taxon topologies under 18 evolutionary scenarios and examined the performance of these methods in assigning confidence to correct monophyletic and incorrect monophyletic groups, and we examined the effects of increasing character number on support value. BMCMC-PP and ML-BP were often strongly correlated with one another but could provide substantially different estimates of support on short internodes. In contrast, BMCMC-PP correlated poorly with MP-BP across most of the simulation conditions that we examined. For a given threshold value, more correct monophyletic groups were supported by BMCMC-PP than by either ML-BP or MP-BP. When threshold values were chosen that fixed the rate of accepting incorrect monophyletic relationship as true at 5%, all three methods recovered most of the correct relationships on the simulated topologies, although BMCMC-PP and ML-BP performed better than MP-BP. BMCMC-PP was usually a less biased predictor of phylogenetic accuracy than either bootstrapping method. BMCMC-PP provided high support values for correct topological bipartitions with fewer characters than was needed for nonparametric bootstrap.},

In this study, we propose a Bayesian method for the estimation of the CCC of skewed data sets and compare it with the best method previously investigated. The proposed method has certain advantages. It tends to outperform the best method studied before when the variation of the data is mainly from the random subject effect instead of error. Furthermore, it allows for greater flexibility in application by enabling incorporation of missing data, confounding covariates, and replications, which was not considered previously. The superiority of this new approach is demonstrated using simulation as well as real-life biomarker data sets used in an electroencephalography clinical study.

Model averaging by using bootstrap replicates with feature selection by thresholding is a widely used solution for learning features with high confidence. Yet, in the context of limited data many questions remain unanswered. What scoring functions are most effective for model averaging? Does the bias arising from the discreteness of the bootstrap significantly affect learning performance? Is it better to pick the single best network or to average multiple networks learnt from each bootstrap resample? How should thresholds for learning statistically significant features be selected? The best scoring functions are Dirichlet Prior Scoring Metric with small λ and the Bayesian Dirichlet metric. Correcting the bias arising from the discreteness of the bootstrap worsens learning performance. It is better to pick the single best network learnt from each bootstrap resample. We describe a permutation based method for determining significance thresholds for feature selection in bagged models. We show that in contexts with limited data, Bayesian bagging using the Dirichlet Prior Scoring Metric (DPSM) is the most effective learning strategy, and that modifying the scoring function to penalize complex networks hampers model averaging. We establish these results using a systematic study of two well-known benchmarks, specifically ALARM and INSURANCE. We also apply our network construction method to gene expression data from the Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma multiforme dataset and show that survival is related to clinical covariates age and gender and clusters for interferon induced genes and growth inhibition genes. For small data sets, our approach performs significantly better than previously published methods.},

We show that Bayesian posterior probabilities are significantly higher than corresponding nonparametric bootstrap frequencies for true clades, but also that erroneous conclusions will be made more often. These errors are strongly accentuated when the models used for analyses are underparameterized. When data are analyzed under the correct model, nonparametric bootstrapping is conservative. Bayesian posterior probabilities are also conservative in this respect, but less so.},

However, few practical applications of the use of Bayesian methods for combining patient-level data (i.e., trial) with additional evidence (e.g., literature) exist in the cost-effectiveness literature. The objective of this study was to compare a Bayesian cost-effectiveness analysis using informative priors to a standard non-Bayesian nonparametric method to assess the impact of incorporating additional information into a cost-effectiveness analysis. Patient-level data from a previously published nonrandomized study were analyzed using traditional nonparametric bootstrap techniques and bivariate normal Bayesian models with vague and informative priors. Two different types of informative priors were considered to reflect different valuations of the additional evidence relative to the patient-level data (i.e., "face value" and "skeptical"). The impact of using different distributions and valuations was assessed in a sensitivity analysis. Models were compared in terms of incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) and cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers (CEAFs). The bootstrapping and Bayesian analyses using vague priors provided similar results. The most pronounced impact of incorporating the informative priors was the increase in estimated life years in the control arm relative to what was observed in the patient-level data alone. Consequently, the incremental difference in life years originally observed in the patient-level data was reduced, and the INMB and CEAF changed accordingly. The results of this study demonstrate the potential impact and importance of incorporating additional information into an analysis of patient-level data, suggesting this could alter decisions as to whether a treatment should be adopted and whether more information should be acquired.},

To apply this concept to epidemiological data, the calculation of a confidence interval to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate is desirable. However, because perhaps of the confusion surrounding the attributable risk measures, there is no standard confidence interval or variance formula given in the literature. In this paper, we implement a fully Bayesian approach to confidence interval construction of the population attributable risk for cross-sectional studies. We show that, in comparison with a number of standard Frequentist methods for constructing confidence intervals (i.e. delta, jackknife and bootstrap methods), the Bayesian approach is superior in terms of percent coverage in all except a few cases. This paper also explores the effect of the chosen prior on the coverage and provides alternatives for particular situations. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Cancer arises from a deregulation of both intracellular and intercellular networks that maintain system homeostasis. Identifying the architecture of these networks and how they are changed in cancer is a pre-requisite for designing drugs to restore homeostasis. Since intercellular networks only appear in intact systems, it is difficult to identify how these networks become altered in human cancer using many of the common experimental models. To overcome this, we used the diversity in normal and malignant human tissue samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database of human breast cancer to identify the topology associated with intercellular networks in vivo. To improve the underlying biological signals, we constructed Bayesian networks using metagene constructs, which represented groups of genes that are concomitantly associated with different immune and cancer states. We also used bootstrap resampling to establish the significance associated with the inferred networks. In short, we found opposing relationships between cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) with regards to macrophage polarization. These results were consistent across multiple carcinomas in that proliferation was associated with a type 1 cell-mediated anti-tumor immune response and EMT was associated with a pro-tumor anti-inflammatory response. To address the identifiability of these networks from other datasets, we could identify the relationship between EMT and macrophage polarization with fewer samples when the Bayesian network was generated from malignant samples alone. However, the relationship between proliferation and macrophage polarization was identified with fewer samples when the samples were taken from a combination of the normal and malignant samples. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

This paper concerns the frequentist assessment of Bayes estimates. A simple formula is shown to give the frequentist standard deviation of a Bayesian point estimate. The same simulations required for the point estimate also produce the standard deviation. Exponential family models make the calculations particularly simple, and bring in a connection to the parametric bootstrap.},

  abstract     = {Recent advances in technology for brain imaging and high-throughput genotyping have motivated studies examining the influence of genetic variation on brain structure. Wang et al. have developed an approach for the analysis of imaging genomic studies using penalized multi-task regression with regularization based on a novel group l2,1-norm penalty which encourages structured sparsity at both the gene level and SNP level. While incorporating a number of useful features, the proposed method only furnishes a point estimate of the regression coefficients; techniques for conducting statistical inference are not provided. A new Bayesian method is proposed here to overcome this limitation. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical modeling formulation where the posterior mode corresponds to the estimator proposed by Wang et al. and an approach that allows for full posterior inference including the construction of interval estimates for the regression parameters. We show that the proposed hierarchical model can be expressed as a three-level Gaussian scale mixture and this representation facilitates the use of a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior simulation. Simulation studies demonstrate that the interval estimates obtained using our approach achieve adequate coverage probabilities that outperform those obtained from the nonparametric bootstrap. Our proposed methodology is applied to the analysis of neuroimaging and genetic data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and this analysis of the ADNI cohort demonstrates clearly the value added of incorporating interval estimation beyond only point estimation when relating SNPs to brain imaging endophenotypes.

In this paper, we develop a "higher posterior probability model with bootstrap" (HPMB) approach to select explanatory variables without fitting all possible GLMMs involving a small or moderate number of explanatory variables. Furthermore, to save computational load, we propose an efficient approximation approach with Laplace's method and Taylor's expansion to approximate intractable integrals in GLMMs. Simulation studies and an application of HapMap data provide evidence that this selection approach is computationally feasible and reliable for exploring true candidate genes and gene-gene associations, after adjusting for complex structures among clusters.},

  abstract        = {Four New World genera of dwarf boas (Exiliboa, Trachyboa, Tropidophis, and Ungaliophis) have been placed by many systematists in a single group (traditionally called Tropidophiidae). However, the monophyly of this group has been questioned in several studies. Moreover, the overall relationships among basal snake lineages, including the placement of the dwarf boas, are poorly understood. We obtained mtDNA sequence data for 12S, 16S, and intervening tRNA-val genes from 23 species of snakes representing most major snake lineages, including all four genera of New World dwarf boas. We then examined the phylogenetic position of these species by estimating the phylogeny of the basal snakes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that New World dwarf boas are not monophyletic. Instead, we find Exiliboa and Ungaliophis to be most closely related to sand boas (Erycinae), boas (Boinae), and advanced snakes (Caenophidea), whereas Tropidophis and Trachyboa form an independent clade that separated relatively early in snake radiation. Our estimate of snake phylogeny differs significantly in other ways from some previous estimates of snake phylogeny. For instance, pythons do not cluster with boas and sand boas, but instead show a strong relationship with Loxocemus and Xenopeltis. Additionally, uropeltids cluster strongly with Cylindrophis, and together are embedded in what has previously been considered the macrostomatan radiation. These relationships are supported by both bootstrapping (parametric and nonparametric approaches) and Bayesian analysis, although Bayesian support values are consistently higher than those obtained from nonparametric bootstrapping. Simulations show that Bayesian support values represent much better estimates of phylogenetic accuracy than do nonparametric bootstrap support values, at least under the conditions of our study.},

  abstract        = {Autonomous chronic disease management requires models that are able to interpret time series data from patients. However, construction of such models by means of machine learning requires the availability of costly health-care data, often resulting in small samples. We analysed data from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with the goal of constructing a model to predict the occurrence of exacerbation events, i.e., episodes of decreased pulmonary health status. Data from 10 COPD patients, gathered with our home monitoring system, were used for temporal Bayesian network learning, combined with bootstrapping methods for data analysis of small data samples. For comparison a temporal variant of augmented naive Bayes models and a temporal nodes Bayesian network (TNBN) were constructed. The performances of the methods were first tested with synthetic data. Subsequently, different COPD models were compared to each other using an external validation data set. The model learning methods are capable of finding good predictive models for our COPD data. Model averaging over models based on bootstrap replications is able to find a good balance between true and false positive rates on predicting COPD exacerbation events. Temporal naive Bayes offers an alternative that trades some performance for a reduction in computation time and easier interpretation.},

Before molecular evolutionary questions regarding genome evolution can be answered, the phylogenetic problems within the family need to be resolved. However, the phylogenetic position of parasitic angiosperms and their precise relationship to nonparasitic relatives are difficult to infer. Problems are encountered with both morphological and molecular evidence. Molecular data have been used in numerous studies to elucidate relationships of parasitic taxa, despite accelerated rates of sequence evolution. To address the question of the position of the genus Cuscuta within Convolvulaceae, we generated a new molecular data set consisting of mitochondrial (atpA) and nuclear (RPB2) genes, and analyzed these data together with an existing chloroplast data matrix (rbcL, atpB, trnL-F, and psbE-J), to which an additional chloroplast gene (rpl2) was added. This data set was analyzed with an array of phylogenetic methods, including Bayesian analysis, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony. Further exploration of data was done by using methods of phylogeny hypothesis testing. At least two nonparasitic lineages are shown to diverge within the Convolvulaceae before Cuscuta. However, the exact sister group of Cuscuta could not be ascertained, even though many alternatives were rejected with confidence. Caution is therefore warranted when interpreting the causes of molecular evolution in Cuscuta. Detailed comparisons with nonparasitic Convolvulaceae are necessary before firm conclusions can be reached regarding the effects of the parasitic mode of life on patterns of molecular evolution in Cuscuta.},

Here, we investigate an approach to distribute the MCMC analysis across a cluster of computers. To do this, we use bootstrapped topologies as fixed genealogies, perform a single MCMC analysis on each genealogy without topological rearrangements, and pool the results across all MCMC analyses. We show, through simulations, that although the standard MCMC performs better than the bootstrap-MCMC at estimating the effective population size (scaled by mutation rate), the bootstrap-MCMC returns better estimates of growth rates. Additionally, we find that our bootstrap-MCMC analyses are, on average, 37 times faster for equivalent effective sample sizes.},

  abstract        = {Multivariate random effects meta-analysis (MRMA) is an appropriate way for synthesizing data from studies reporting multiple correlated outcomes. In a Bayesian framework, it has great potential for integrating evidence from a variety of sources. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model for MRMA of mixed outcomes, which extends previously developed bivariate models to the trivariate case and also allows for combination of multiple outcomes that are both continuous and binary. We have constructed informative prior distributions for the correlations by using external evidence. Prior distributions for the within-study correlations were constructed by employing external individual patent data and using a double bootstrap method to obtain the correlations between mixed outcomes. The between-study model of MRMA was parameterized in the form of a product of a series of univariate conditional normal distributions. This allowed us to place explicit prior distributions on the between-study correlations, which were constructed using external summary data. Traditionally, independent 'vague' prior distributions are placed on all parameters of the model. In contrast to this approach, we constructed prior distributions for the between-study model parameters in a way that takes into account the inter-relationship between them. This is a flexible method that can be extended to incorporate mixed outcomes other than continuous and binary and beyond the trivariate case. We have applied this model to a motivating example in rheumatoid arthritis with the aim of incorporating all available evidence in the synthesis and potentially reducing uncertainty around the estimate of interest.},

  abstract        = {Contrived and simulated examples were used to quantify the range of conditions in which maximum likelihood and Bayesian MCMC methods are biased in favor of phylogenetic signal present in globally sampled characters over that present in conflicting locally sampled characters (those with missing data). The bias occurs in both the optimal tree identified as well as branch supports even when there are more locally sampled characters supporting the conflicting topology. The bias can lead to high bootstrap, SH-like aLRT support (up to 100%), and posterior probabilities for the conflicting clades. The bias can occur even when only a single terminal has missing data. The bias is not limited to likelihood methods that only ever present a single optimal tree that is fully resolved (as in PhyML and RAxML)-it can also occur in branch-and-bound PAUP(∗) searches. The bias persists despite sampling numerous characters, and the bias is consistently unidirectional. The bias may occur in the context of incongruence between gene trees as well as within a single gene wherein terminals have different sequence lengths caused by DNA-amplification differences or gaps caused by indels. This bias is another example wherein commonly implemented parametric phylogenetic methods interpret ambiguity as support. In contrast, parsimony is robust to the bias.},

  abstract        = {Aberrant activation of sonic Hegdehog (SHH) signaling has been found to disrupt cellular differentiation in many human cancers and to increase proliferation. The SHH pathway is known to cross-talk with EGFR dependent signaling. Recent studies experimentally addressed this interplay in Daoy cells, which are presumable a model system for medulloblastoma, a highly malignant brain tumor that predominately occurs in children. Currently ongoing are several clinical trials for different solid cancers, which are designed to validate the clinical benefits of targeting the SHH in combination with other pathways. This has motivated us to investigate interactions between EGFR and SHH dependent signaling in greater depth. To our knowledge, there is no mathematical model describing the interplay between EGFR and SHH dependent signaling in medulloblastoma so far. Here we come up with a fully probabilistic approach using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). To build our model, we made use of literature based knowledge describing SHH and EGFR signaling and integrated gene expression (Illumina) and cellular location dependent time series protein expression data (Reverse Phase Protein Arrays). We validated our model by sub-sampling training data and making Bayesian predictions on the left out test data. Our predictions focusing on key transcription factors and p70S6K, showed a high level of concordance with experimental data. Furthermore, the stability of our model was tested by a parametric bootstrap approach. Stable network features were in agreement with published data. Altogether we believe that our model improved our understanding of the interplay between two highly oncogenic signaling pathways in Daoy cells. This may open new perspectives for the future therapy of Hedghog/EGF-dependent solid tumors.},

  abstract        = {Abacavir is used to treat HIV infection in both adults and children. The recommended paediatric dose is 8 mg kg(-1) twice daily up to a maximum of 300 mg twice daily. Weight was identified as the central covariate influencing pharmacokinetics of abacavir in children. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed to describe both once and twice daily pharmacokinetic profiles of abacavir in infants and toddlers. Standard dosage regimen is associated with large interindividual variability in abacavir concentrations. A maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian estimator of AUC(0-) (t) based on three time points (0, 1 or 2, and 3 h) is proposed to support area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) targeted individualized therapy in infants and toddlers. To develop a population pharmacokinetic model for abacavir in HIV-infected infants and toddlers, which will be used to describe both once and twice daily pharmacokinetic profiles, identify covariates that explain variability and propose optimal time points to optimize the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) targeted dosage and individualize therapy. The pharmacokinetics of abacavir was described with plasma concentrations from 23 patients using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling (NONMEM) software. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was developed. The final model was validated using bootstrap, visual predictive check and normalized prediction distribution errors. The Bayesian estimator was validated using the cross-validation and simulation-estimation method. The typical population pharmacokinetic parameters and relative standard errors (RSE) were apparent systemic clearance (CL) 13.4 () h−1 (RSE 6.3%), apparent central volume of distribution 4.94 () (RSE 28.7%), apparent peripheral volume of distribution 8.12 () (RSE14.2%), apparent intercompartment clearance 1.25 () h−1 (RSE 16.9%) and absorption rate constant 0.758 h−1 (RSE 5.8%). The covariate analysis identified weight as the individual factor influencing the apparent oral clearance: CL = 13.4 × (weight/12)1.14. The maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian estimator, based on three concentrations measured at 0, 1 or 2, and 3 h after drug intake allowed predicting individual AUC0–t. The population pharmacokinetic model developed for abacavir in HIV-infected infants and toddlers accurately described both once and twice daily pharmacokinetic profiles. The maximum a posteriori probability Bayesian estimator of AUC(0-) (t) was developed from the final model and can be used routinely to optimize individual dosing.},

  abstract        = {Species-level classification for 16S rRNA gene sequences remains a serious challenge for microbiome researchers, because existing taxonomic classification tools for 16S rRNA gene sequences either do not provide species-level classification, or their classification results are unreliable. The unreliable results are due to the limitations in the existing methods which either lack solid probabilistic-based criteria to evaluate the confidence of their taxonomic assignments, or use nucleotide k-mer frequency as the proxy for sequence similarity measurement. We have developed a method that shows significantly improved species-level classification results over existing methods. Our method calculates true sequence similarity between query sequences and database hits using pairwise sequence alignment. Taxonomic classifications are assigned from the species to the phylum levels based on the lowest common ancestors of multiple database hits for each query sequence, and further classification reliabilities are evaluated by bootstrap confidence scores. The novelty of our method is that the contribution of each database hit to the taxonomic assignment of the query sequence is weighted by a Bayesian posterior probability based upon the degree of sequence similarity of the database hit to the query sequence. Our method does not need any training datasets specific for different taxonomic groups. Instead only a reference database is required for aligning to the query sequences, making our method easily applicable for different regions of the 16S rRNA gene or other phylogenetic marker genes. Reliable species-level classification for 16S rRNA or other phylogenetic marker genes is critical for microbiome research. Our software shows significantly higher classification accuracy than the existing tools and we provide probabilistic-based confidence scores to evaluate the reliability of our taxonomic classification assignments based on multiple database matches to query sequences. Despite its higher computational costs, our method is still suitable for analyzing large-scale microbiome datasets for practical purposes. Furthermore, our method can be applied for taxonomic classification of any phylogenetic marker gene sequences. Our software, called BLCA, is freely available at https://github.com/qunfengdong/BLCA .},

  abstract     = {Many analyses for the detection of biological phenomena rely on a multiple sequence alignment as input. The results of such analyses are often further studied through parametric bootstrap procedures, using sequence simulators. One of the problems with conducting such simulation studies is that users currently have no means to decide which insertion and deletion (indel) parameters to choose, so that the resulting sequences mimic biological data. Here, we present SpartaABC, a web server that aims to solve this issue. SpartaABC implements an approximate-Bayesian-computation rejection algorithm to infer indel parameters from sequence data. It does so by extracting summary statistics from the input. It then performs numerous sequence simulations under randomly sampled indel parameters. By computing a distance between the summary statistics extracted from the input and each simulation, SpartaABC retains only parameters behind simulations close to the real data. As output, SpartaABC provides point estimates and approximate posterior distributions of the indel parameters. In addition, SpartaABC allows simulating sequences with the inferred indel parameters. To this end, the sequence simulators, Dawg 2.0 and INDELible were integrated. Using SpartaABC we demonstrate the differences in indel dynamics among three protein-coding genes across mammalian orthologs.

  abstract        = {Phylogeny estimation is extremely crucial in the study of molecular evolution. The increase in the amount of available genomic data facilitates phylogeny estimation from multilocus sequence data. Although maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are available for phylogeny reconstruction using multilocus sequence data, these methods require heavy computation, and their application is limited to the analysis of a moderate number of genes and taxa. Distance matrix methods present suitable alternatives for analyzing huge amounts of sequence data. However, the manner in which distance methods can be applied to multilocus sequence data remains unknown. Here, we suggest new procedures to estimate molecular phylogeny using multilocus sequence data and evaluate its significance in the framework of the distance method. We found that concatenation of the multilocus sequence data may result in incorrect phylogeny estimation with an extremely high bootstrap probability (BP), which is due to incorrect estimation of the distances and intentional ignorance of the intergene variations. Therefore, we suggest that the distance matrices for multilocus sequence data be estimated separately and these matrices be subsequently combined to reconstruct phylogeny instead of phylogeny reconstruction using concatenated sequence data. To calculate the BPs of the reconstructed phylogeny, we suggest that 2-stage bootstrap procedures be adopted; in this, genes are resampled followed by resampling of the sequence columns within the resampled genes. By resampling the genes during calculation of BPs, intergene variations are properly considered. Via simulation studies and empirical data analysis, we demonstrate that our 2-stage bootstrap procedures are more suitable than the conventional bootstrap procedure that is adopted after sequence concatenation.},

This model shows how statistical learning can induce this relation, reorganizing its procedures as it does so in roughly the way children do. We question, however, Piantadosi et al.'s claim that the model performs "Quinian bootstrapping," in the sense of Carey (2009). Unlike bootstrapping, the concept it learns is not discontinuous with the concepts it starts with. Instead, the model learns by recombining its primitives into hypotheses and confirming them statistically. As such, it accords better with earlier claims (Fodor, 1975, 1981) that learning does not increase expressive power. We also question the relevance of the simulation for children's learning. The model starts with a preselected set of15 primitives, and the procedure it learns differs from children's method. Finally, the partial knowledge of the positive integers that the model attains is consistent with an infinite number of nonstandard meanings-for example, that the integers stop after ten or loop from ten back to one.},

  abstract        = {The benchmark dose (BMD) approach has gained acceptance as a valuable risk assessment tool, but risk assessors still face significant challenges associated with selecting an appropriate BMD/BMDL estimate from the results of a set of acceptable dose-response models. Current approaches do not explicitly address model uncertainty, and there is an existing need to more fully inform health risk assessors in this regard. In this study, a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) BMD estimation method taking model uncertainty into account is proposed as an alternative to current BMD estimation approaches for continuous data. Using the "hybrid" method proposed by Crump, two strategies of BMA, including both "maximum likelihood estimation based" and "Markov Chain Monte Carlo based" methods, are first applied as a demonstration to calculate model averaged BMD estimates from real continuous dose-response data. The outcomes from the example data sets examined suggest that the BMA BMD estimates have higher reliability than the estimates from the individual models with highest posterior weight in terms of higher BMDL and smaller 90th percentile intervals. In addition, a simulation study is performed to evaluate the accuracy of the BMA BMD estimator. The results from the simulation study recommend that the BMA BMD estimates have smaller bias than the BMDs selected using other criteria. To further validate the BMA method, some technical issues, including the selection of models and the use of bootstrap methods for BMDL derivation, need further investigation over a more extensive, representative set of dose-response data.},

The bootstrap operates by resampling (with replacement) from the original BMC sample, and redoing the decision analysis. Repeating this procedure yields a distribution of decision analysis outputs. The bootstrap approach to estimating the effect of sample error upon BMC analysis is illustrated with a simple value-of-information calculation along with an analysis of a proposed control structure for Lake Erie. The examples show that the outputs of BMC decision analysis can have high levels of sample error and bias.},

  abstract        = {Increasing evidence points to the role of tumor immunologic environment on urothelial bladder cancer prognosis. This effect might be partly dependent on the host genetic context. We evaluated the association of SNPs in inflammation-related genes with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) risk-of-recurrence and risk-of-progression. We considered 822 NMIBC included in the SBC/EPICURO Study followed-up >10 years. We selected 1,679 SNPs belonging to 251 inflammatory genes. The association of SNPs with risk-of-recurrence and risk-of-progression was assessed using Cox regression single-marker (SMM) and multimarker methods (MMM) Bayes A and Bayesian LASSO. Discriminative abilities of the models were calculated using the c index and validated with bootstrap cross-validation procedures. While no SNP was found to be associated with risk-of-recurrence using SMM, three SNPs in TNIP1, CD5, and JAK3 showed very strong association with posterior probabilities >90% using MMM. Regarding risk-of-progression, one SNP in CD3G was significantly associated using SMM (HR, 2.69; P = 1.55 × 10(-5)) and two SNPs in MASP1 and AIRE, showed a posterior probability ≥80% with MMM. Validated discriminative abilities of the models without and with the SNPs were 58.4% versus 60.5% and 72.1% versus 72.8% for risk-of-recurrence and risk-of-progression, respectively. Using innovative analytic approaches, we demonstrated that SNPs in inflammatory-related genes were associated with NMIBC prognosis and that they improve the discriminative ability of prognostic clinical models for NMIBC. This study provides proof of concept for the joint effect of genetic variants in improving the discriminative ability of clinical prognostic models. The approach may be extended to other diseases.

As an alternative, we propose a Bayesian approach that accounts for parameter constraints and estimates the RERIOR in a case-control study from a linear additive odds-ratio model, or the RERI in a cohort study from a linear additive risk-ratio model. We show that Bayesian credible intervals can often be obtained more easily than frequentist confidence intervals. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach can be easily extended to adjust for confounders. Because posterior computation with inequality constraints can be accomplished easily using free software, the proposed Bayesian approaches may be useful in practice.},

We propose a new Bayesian approach to robotic learning by imitation inspired by the developmental hypothesis that children use self-experience to bootstrap the process of intention recognition and goal-based imitation. Our approach allows an autonomous agent to: (i) learn probabilistic models of actions through self-discovery and experience, (ii) utilize these learned models for inferring the goals of human actions, and (iii) perform goal-based imitation for robotic learning and human-robot collaboration. Such an approach allows a robot to leverage its increasing repertoire of learned behaviors to interpret increasingly complex human actions and use the inferred goals for imitation, even when the robot has very different actuators from humans. We demonstrate our approach using two different scenarios: (i) a simulated robot that learns human-like gaze following behavior, and (ii) a robot that learns to imitate human actions in a tabletop organization task. In both cases, the agent learns a probabilistic model of its own actions, and uses this model for goal inference and goal-based imitation. We also show that the robotic agent can use its probabilistic model to seek human assistance when it recognizes that its inferred actions are too uncertain, risky, or impossible to perform, thereby opening the door to human-robot collaboration.},

Mixed-effect logistic regressions were used to build the model. Missing values were imputed by the use of multiple imputations. The following 5 variable selection methods were compared: bootstrap receiver-operative characteristic (ROC), bootstrap Akaike information criteria, bootstrap Bayesian information criteria, and stepwise forward and stepwise backward methods. The final model's prediction performance was evaluated by the use of Frank Harrell's calibration curve and using a multifold cross-validation approach. Stepwise forward and backward methods selected same set of 21 variables into the model with the area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.8490. The bootstrap ROC method selected 13 variables with AUC of 0.8450. Bootstrap Bayesian information criteria and Akaike information criteria respectively selected 16 (AUC: 0.8470) and 23 (AUC: 0.8491) variables. Bootstrap ROC model was selected as the final model which showed very good discrimination and calibration power.

  abstract        = {To develop a novel warfarin-dosing algorithm based on a previous population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model with Bayesian forecasting to facilitate warfarin therapy. Using information on CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes, S-warfarin level, dose and international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time, individual PK (apparent clearance of S-warfarin [CLs]) and PD (concentration resulting in 50% of E(max) [EC(50)]) parameters were determined by Bayesian forecasting for 45 Japanese patients. Maintenance doses were described by multiple linear regression using individually estimated PK/PD parameters and INR values. The validity of the model and a comparison with other dosing methods were evaluated by bootstrap resampling and a cross-validation method. The plasma concentration of S-warfarin and INR were accurately predicted from individual PK/PD parameters. The following final regression model for maintenance dose was obtained; maintenance dose = 11.2 x CLs + 0.91 x EC(50) + 2.36 x INR - 9.67, giving a strong correlation between actual and predicted maintenance doses (r(2) = 0.944). Bootstrap resampling and cross-validation showed robustness and a superior predictive performance compared with other dosing methods. On the other hand, the predictability without actual measurements (S-warfarin and INR values) and Bayesian inference was comparable to other dosing methods. A novel algorithm, based on the population PK/PD model combined with Bayesian forecasting, gave precise predictions of maintenance dose, leading to individualized warfarin therapy.},

  abstract     = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) played an important role in shaping microbial genomes. In addition to genes under sporadic selection, HGT also affects housekeeping genes and those involved in information processing, even ribosomal RNA encoding genes. Here we describe tools that provide an assessment and graphic illustration of the mosaic nature of microbial genomes. We adapted the Maximum Likelihood (ML) mapping to the analyses of all detected quartets of orthologous genes found in four genomes. We have automated the assembly and analyses of these quartets of orthologs given the selection of four genomes. We compared the ML-mapping approach to more rigorous Bayesian probability and Bootstrap mapping techniques. The latter two approaches appear to be more conservative than the ML-mapping approach, but qualitatively all three approaches give equivalent results. All three tools were tested on mitochondrial genomes, which presumably were inherited as a single linkage group. In some instances of interphylum relationships we find nearly equal numbers of quartets strongly supporting the three possible topologies. In contrast, our analyses of genome quartets containing the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. indicate that a large part of the cyanobacterial genome is related to that of low GC Gram positives. Other groups that had been suggested as sister groups to the cyanobacteria contain many fewer genes that group with the Synechocystis orthologs. Interdomain comparisons of genome quartets containing the archaeon Halobacterium sp. revealed that Halobacterium sp. shares more genes with Bacteria that live in the same environment than with Bacteria that are more closely related based on rRNA phylogeny. Many of these genes encode proteins involved in substrate transport and metabolism and in information storage and processing. The performed analyses demonstrate that relationships among prokaryotes cannot be accurately depicted by or inferred from the tree-like evolution of a core of rarely transferred genes; rather prokaryotic genomes are mosaics in which different parts have different evolutionary histories. Probability mapping is a valuable tool to explore the mosaic nature of genomes.},

  abstract        = {Bayesian phylogenetic inference holds promise as an alternative to maximum likelihood, particularly for large molecular-sequence data sets. We have investigated the performance of Bayesian inference with empirical and simulated protein-sequence data under conditions of relative branch-length differences and model violation. With empirical protein-sequence data, Bayesian posterior probabilities provide more-generous estimates of subtree reliability than does the nonparametric bootstrap combined with maximum likelihood inference, reaching 100% posterior probability at bootstrap proportions around 80%. With simulated 7-taxon protein-sequence datasets, Bayesian posterior probabilities are somewhat more generous than bootstrap proportions, but do not saturate. Compared with likelihood, Bayesian phylogenetic inference can be as or more robust to relative branch-length differences for datasets of this size, particularly when among-sites rate variation is modeled using a gamma distribution. When the (known) correct model was used to infer trees, Bayesian inference recovered the (known) correct tree in 100% of instances in which one or two branches were up to 20-fold longer than the others. At ratios more extreme than 20-fold, topological accuracy of reconstruction degraded only slowly when only one branch was of relatively greater length, but more rapidly when there were two such branches. Under an incorrect model of sequence change, inaccurate trees were sometimes observed at less extreme branch-length ratios, and (particularly for trees with single long branches) such trees tended to be more inaccurate. The effect of model violation on accuracy of reconstruction for trees with two long branches was more variable, but gamma-corrected Bayesian inference nonetheless yielded more-accurate trees than did either maximum likelihood or uncorrected Bayesian inference across the range of conditions we examined. Assuming an exponential Bayesian prior on branch lengths did not improve, and under certain extreme conditions significantly diminished, performance. The two topology-comparison metrics we employed, edit distance and Robinson-Foulds symmetric distance, yielded different but highly complementary measures of performance. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian inference can be relatively robust against biologically reasonable levels of relative branch-length differences and model violation, and thus may provide a promising alternative to maximum likelihood for inference of phylogenetic trees from protein-sequence data.},

defined as the process of graphically
displaying scientific data. However, this
process is far from direct or automatic.
There are so many different ways to
represent the same data: scatter plots,
linear plots, bar plots, and pie charts, to
name just a few. Furthermore, the same
data, using the same type of plot, may be
perceived very differently depending on
who is looking at the figure. A more
accurate definition for scientific visualization
would be a graphical interface
between people and data. In this short
article, we do not pretend to explain
everything about this interface; rather, see
[1,2] for introductory work. Instead we
aim to provide a basic set of rules to
improve figure design and to explain
some of the common pitfalls.},

This includes such systems as oligomeric polyelectrolytes at a finite concentration in aqueous and various non-aqueous solutions, as well as drug-like compounds in solution. The new closure by Kobryn, Gusarov, and Kovalenko (KGK closure) imposes the mean spherical approximation (MSA) almost everywhere in the solvation shell but levels out the density distribution function to zero (with the continuity at joint boundaries) inside the repulsive core and in the spatial regions of strong density depletion emerging due to molecular associative interactions. Similarly to MSA, the KGK closure reduces the problem to a linear equation for the direct correlation function which is predefined analytically on most of the solvation shells and has to be determined numerically on a relatively small (three-dimensional) domain of strong depletion, typically within the repulsive core. The KGK closure leads to the solvation free energy in the form of the Gaussian fluctuation (GF) functional. We first test the performance of the KGK closure coupled to the reference interaction site model (RISM) integral equations on the examples of Lennard-Jones liquids, polar and nonpolar molecular solvents, including water, and aqueous solutions of simple ions. The solvation structure, solvation chemical potential, and compressibility obtained from RISM with the KGK closure favorably compare to the results of the hypernetted chain (HNC) and Kovalenko–Hirata (KH) closures, including their combination with the GF solvation free energy. We then use the KGK closure coupled to RISM to obtain the solvation structure and thermodynamics of oligomeric polyelectrolytes and drug-like compounds at a finite concentration in electrolyte solution, for which no convergence is obtained with other closures. For comparison, we calculate their solvation structure from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We further couple the 3D-RISM integral equation with the 3D-version of the KGK closure, and solve it for molecular mixtures as well as oligomeric polyelectrolytes and drug-like molecules in electrolyte solutions.},

Details are provided that allow for academic researchers from diverse backgrounds to build this DLS instrument with minimal effort and at a low cost. This approach, while providing good sensitivity and high accuracy (e.g., measuring the size of latex standards to within 1% relative standard deviation), possesses several advantages not found, in their entirety, in existing DLS instrumentation. It was observed that, even though an arbitrary scattering angle could be selected, aligning this instrument to obtain optimal detection efficiency can be completed in as little as a few minutes. Also, complications associated with light refraction at the sample cell interface are avoided. Small volumes (<10 µL) can be measured, for example, by hanging a solution droplet from the fiber optic probe tips. In addition, use of fiber optic probes allows the beam path length to be as short as 1.6 mm while measuring at 90°, which reduces the likelihood of multiple scattering. With minimal customization, compact submersible probes and a portable battery-operated DLS instrument were made as examples of potential implementation. Finally, this approach is versatile, and can be incorporated into a wide variety of reactors, for in situ characterization, and other instrumentation for hybrid measurements. This type of in situ measurement was conducted after mounting the DLS probes inside a standard three-neck flask. This allowed for direct monitoring of the growth of silica nanoparticles prepared via Stöber synthesis.},

Computational models have proved to be a powerful tool to analyze and understand the impact of mutations and to overcome their structural and functional influence in drug resistance. With the availability of structural data, in silico experiments have been instrumental in exploiting and improving interactions between drugs and viral targets, such as HIV protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. Issues such as viral target dynamics and mutational variability, as well as the role of water and estimates of binding free energy in characterizing ligand interactions, are areas of active computational research. Ever-increasing computational resources and theoretical and algorithmic advances have played a significant role in progress to date, and we envision a continually expanding role for computational methods in our understanding of HIV biology and SBDD in the future.},

The hydration force field accounts for the entropic and enthalpic contributions of discrete waters to ligand binding, improving energy estimation accuracy and docking performance. The force field has been calibrated and validated on a total of 417 complexes (197 training set; 220 test set), then tested in cross-docking experiments, for a total of 1649 ligand-protein complexes evaluated. The method is computationally efficient and was used to model up to 35 waters during docking. The method was implemented and tested using unaltered AutoDock4 with new force field tables.},

  abstract     = {Drug candidates are generally discovered using biochemical screens employing an isolated target protein or by utilizing cell-based phenotypic assays. Both noncovalent and covalent hits emerge from such endeavors. Herein, we exemplify an "Inverse Drug Discovery" strategy in which organic compounds of intermediate complexity harboring weak, but activatable, electrophiles are matched with the protein(s) they react with in cells or cell lysate. An alkyne substructure in each candidate small molecule enables affinity chromatography-mass spectrometry, which produces a list of proteins that each distinct compound reacts with. A notable feature of this approach is that it is agnostic with respect to the cellular proteins targeted. To illustrate this strategy, we employed aryl fluorosulfates, an underexplored class of sulfur(VI) halides, that are generally unreactive unless activated by protein binding. Reversible aryl fluorosulfate binding, correct juxtaposition of protein side chain functional groups, and transition-state stabilization of the S(VI) exchange reaction all seem to be critical for conjugate formation. The aryl fluorosulfates studied thus far exhibit chemoselective reactivity toward Lys and, particularly, Tyr side chains, and can be used to target nonenzymes (e.g., a hormone carrier or a small-molecule carrier protein) as well as enzymes. The "Inverse Drug Discovery" strategy should be particularly attractive as a means to explore latent electrophiles not typically used in medicinal chemistry efforts, until one reacts with a protein target of exceptional interest. Structure-activity data can then be used to enhance the selectivity of conjugate formation or the covalent probe can be used as a competitor to develop noncovalent drug candidates. Here we use the "Inverse Drug Discovery" platform to identify and validate covalent ligands for 11 different human proteins. In the case of one of these proteins, we have identified and validated a small-molecule probe for the first time.},

For this reason, MK2 was identified as an alternative target to block the pathway but avoiding the side effects of p38 inhibition. However, ATP-competitive MK2 inhibitors suffered from low solubility, poor cell permeability, and scarce kinase selectivity. Fortunately, non-ATP-competitive inhibitors of MK2 have been already discovered that allowed circumventing the selectivity issue. These compounds showed the additional advantage to be effective at lower concentrations in comparison to the ATP-competitive inhibitors. Therefore, although the significant difficulties encountered during the development of these inhibitors, MK2 is still considered as an attractive target to treat inflammation and related diseases to prevent tumor metastasis and to increase tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutics.},

The challenges of this approach include the: 1) exponential growth of the search space, demanding more efficient search methods; and 2) increased number of false positives, calling for scoring functions tailored for flexible receptor docking. We present AutoDockFR-AutoDock for Flexible Receptors (ADFR), a new docking engine based on the AutoDock4 scoring function, which addresses the aforementioned challenges with a new Genetic Algorithm (GA) and customized scoring function. We validate ADFR using the Astex Diverse Set, demonstrating an increase in efficiency and reliability of its GA over the one implemented in AutoDock4. We demonstrate greatly increased success rates when cross-docking ligands into apo receptors that require side-chain conformational changes for ligand binding. These cross-docking experiments are based on two datasets: 1) SEQ17 -a receptor diversity set containing 17 pairs of apo-holo structures; and 2) CDK2 -a ligand diversity set composed of one CDK2 apo structure and 52 known bound inhibitors. We show that, when cross-docking ligands into the apo conformation of the receptors with up to 14 flexible side-chains, ADFR reports more correctly cross-docked ligands than AutoDock Vina on both datasets with solutions found for 70.6% vs. 35.3% systems on SEQ17, and 76.9% vs. 61.5% on CDK2. ADFR also outperforms AutoDock Vina in number of top ranking solutions on both datasets. Furthermore, we show that correctly docked CDK2 complexes re-create on average 79.8% of all pairwise atomic interactions between the ligand and moving receptor atoms in the holo complexes. Finally, we show that down-weighting the receptor internal energy improves the ranking of correctly docked poses and that runtime for AutoDockFR scales linearly when side-chain flexibility is added.},

  abstract        = {HIV-1 integrase (IN) is essential for virus replication and represents an important multifunctional therapeutic target. Recently discovered quinoline-based allosteric IN inhibitors (ALLINIs) potently impair HIV-1 replication and are currently in clinical trials. ALLINIs exhibit a multimodal mechanism of action by inducing aberrant IN multimerization during virion morphogenesis and by competing with IN for binding to its cognate cellular cofactor LEDGF/p75 during early steps of HIV-1 infection. However, quinoline-based ALLINIs impose a low genetic barrier for the evolution of resistant phenotypes, which highlights a need for discovery of second-generation inhibitors. Using crystallographic screening of a library of 971 fragments against the HIV-1 IN catalytic core domain (CCD) followed by a fragment expansion approach, we have identified thiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives that bind at the CCD-CCD dimer interface at the principal lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)/p75 binding pocket. The most active derivative (5) inhibited LEDGF/p75-dependent HIV-1 IN activity in vitro with an IC  of 72 μm and impaired HIV-1 infection of T cells at an EC  of 36 μm The identified lead compound, with a relatively small molecular weight (221 Da), provides an optimal building block for developing a new class of inhibitors. Furthermore, although structurally distinct thiophenecarboxylic acid derivatives target a similar pocket at the IN dimer interface as the quinoline-based ALLINIs, the lead compound, 5, inhibited IN mutants that confer resistance to quinoline-based compounds. Collectively, our findings provide a plausible path for structure-based development of second-generation ALLINIs.},

Anacardic acid, the primary active component of cashew nut shell extract, is a natural product used in the treatment of a variety of medical conditions, including infectious abscesses. Here, we investigate the effects of this natural product on the function of human neutrophils. We find that anacardic acid stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species and neutrophil extracellular traps, two mechanisms utilized by neutrophils to kill invading bacteria. Molecular modeling and pharmacological inhibitor studies suggest anacardic acid stimulation of neutrophils occurs in a PI3K-dependent manner through activation of surface-expressed G protein-coupled sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors. Neutrophil extracellular traps produced in response to anacardic acid are bactericidal and complement select direct antimicrobial activities of the compound.},

Most human proteins, however, lack small-molecule ligands, and entire protein classes are considered 'undruggable'. Fragment-based ligand discovery can identify small-molecule probes for proteins that have proven difficult to target using high-throughput screening of complex compound libraries. Although reversibly binding ligands are commonly pursued, covalent fragments provide an alternative route to small-molecule probes, including those that can access regions of proteins that are difficult to target through binding affinity alone. Here we report a quantitative analysis of cysteine-reactive small-molecule fragments screened against thousands of proteins in human proteomes and cells. Covalent ligands were identified for >700 cysteines found in both druggable proteins and proteins deficient in chemical probes, including transcription factors, adaptor/scaffolding proteins, and uncharacterized proteins. Among the atypical ligand-protein interactions discovered were compounds that react preferentially with pro- (inactive) caspases. We used these ligands to distinguish extrinsic apoptosis pathways in human cell lines versus primary human T cells, showing that the former is largely mediated by caspase-8 while the latter depends on both caspase-8 and -10. Fragment-based covalent ligand discovery provides a greatly expanded portrait of the ligandable proteome and furnishes compounds that can illuminate protein functions in native biological systems.},

These modifications are catalyzed by serine-arginine protein kinases (SRPKs) that phosphorylate numerous serines in arginine-serine-rich (RS) domains of SR proteins using a directional, C-to-N-terminal mechanism. The present studies explore how SRPKs govern this highly biased phosphorylation reaction and investigate biological roles of the observed directional phosphorylation mechanism. Using NMR spectroscopy with two separately expressed domains of SRSF1, we showed that several residues in the RNA-binding motif 2 interact with the N-terminal region of the RS domain (RS1). These contacts provide a structural framework that balances the activities of SRPK1 and the protein phosphatase PP1, thereby regulating the phosphoryl content of the RS domain. Disruption of the implicated intramolecular RNA-binding motif 2-RS domain interaction impairs both the directional phosphorylation mechanism and the nuclear translocation of SRSF1 demonstrating that the intrinsic phosphorylation bias is obligatory for SR protein biological function.},

However, the accuracy of docking calculations can be limited by factors such as the neglect of protein reorganization in the scoring function; as a result, ligand screening can produce a high rate of false positive hits. Although absolute binding free energy methods still have difficulty in accurately rank-ordering binders, we believe that they can be fruitfully employed to distinguish binders from nonbinders and reduce the false positive rate. Here we study a set of ligands that dock favorably to a newly discovered, potentially allosteric site on the flap of HIV-1 protease. Fragment binding to this site stabilizes a closed form of protease, which could be exploited for the design of allosteric inhibitors. Twenty-three top-ranked protein-ligand complexes from AutoDock were subject to the free energy screening using two methods, the recently developed binding energy analysis method (BEDAM) and the standard double decoupling method (DDM). Free energy calculations correctly identified most of the false positives (≥83%) and recovered all the confirmed binders. The results show a gap averaging ≥3.7 kcal/mol, separating the binders and the false positives. We present a formula that decomposes the binding free energy into contributions from the receptor conformational macrostates, which provides insights into the roles of different binding modes. Our binding free energy component analysis further suggests that improving the treatment for the desolvation penalty associated with the unfulfilled polar groups could reduce the rate of false positive hits in docking. The current study demonstrates that the combination of docking with free energy methods can be very useful for more accurate ligand screening against valuable drug targets.},

  abstract        = {Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infects 200 million individuals worldwide. Although several FDA approved drugs targeting the HCV serine protease and polymerase have shown promising results, there is a need for better drugs that are effective in treating a broader range of HCV genotypes and subtypes without being used in combination with interferon and/or ribavirin. Recently, two crystal structures of the core of the HCV E2 protein (E2c) have been determined, providing structural information that can now be used to target the E2 protein and develop drugs that disrupt the early stages of HCV infection by blocking E2's interaction with different host factors. Using the E2c structure as a template, we have created a structural model of the E2 protein core (residues 421-645) that contains the three amino acid segments that are not present in either structure. Computational docking of a diverse library of 1,715 small molecules to this model led to the identification of a set of 34 ligands predicted to bind near conserved amino acid residues involved in the HCV E2: CD81 interaction. Surface plasmon resonance detection was used to screen the ligand set for binding to recombinant E2 protein, and the best binders were subsequently tested to identify compounds that inhibit the infection of Huh-7 cells by HCV. One compound, 281816, blocked E2 binding to CD81 and inhibited HCV infection in a genotype-independent manner with IC50's ranging from 2.2 µM to 4.6 µM. 281816 blocked the early and late steps of cell-free HCV entry and also abrogated the cell-to-cell transmission of HCV. Collectively the results obtained with this new structural model of E2c suggest the development of small molecule inhibitors such as 281816 that target E2 and disrupt its interaction with CD81 may provide a new paradigm for HCV treatment.},

  abstract        = {Isoniazid (INH) is usually administered to treat latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections and is used in combination therapy to treat active tuberculosis (TB). Unfortunately, resistance to this drug is hampering its clinical effectiveness. INH is a prodrug that must be activated by Mtb catalase-peroxidase (KatG) before it can inhibit InhA (Mtb enoyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase). Isoniazid-resistant cases of TB found in clinical settings usually involve mutations in or deletion of katG, which abrogate INH activation. Compounds that inhibit InhA without requiring prior activation by KatG would not be affected by this resistance mechanism and hence would display continued potency against these drug-resistant isolates of Mtb. Virtual screening experiments versus InhA in the GO Fight Against Malaria (GO FAM) project were designed to discover new scaffolds that display base-stacking interactions with the NAD cofactor. GO FAM experiments included targets from other pathogens, including Mtb, when they had structural similarity to a malaria target. Eight of the 16 soluble compounds identified by docking against InhA plus visual inspection were modest inhibitors and did not require prior activation by KatG. The best two inhibitors discovered are both fragment-sized compounds and displayed Ki values of 54 and 59 μM, respectively. Importantly, the novel inhibitors discovered have low structural similarity to known InhA inhibitors and thus help expand the number of chemotypes on which future medicinal chemistry efforts can be focused. These new fragment hits could eventually help advance the fight against INH-resistant Mtb strains, which pose a significant global health threat.},

Often, fragments are weak binders with partial occupancy, resulting in weak, difficult-to-fit electron density. The use of a brominated fragment library addresses this challenge, as bromine can be located unequivocally via anomalous scattering. Data collection was carried out in an automated fashion using AutoDrug at SSRL. Novel hits were identified in the known surface sites: 3-bromo-2,6-dimethoxybenzoic acid (Br6) in the flap site and 1-bromo-2-naphthoic acid (Br27) in the exosite, expanding the chemistry of known fragments for development of higher affinity potential allosteric inhibitors. At the same time, mapping the binding sites of a number of weaker binding Br-fragments provides further insight into the nature of these surface pockets.},

The challenge encompassed three components--a small "virtual screening" challenge, a binding mode prediction component, and a small affinity prediction component. Here, we give summary results and statistics concerning the performance of all submissions at each of these challenges. Virtual screening was particularly challenging here in part because, in contrast to more typical virtual screening test sets, the inactive compounds were tested because they were thought to be likely binders, so only the very top predictions performed significantly better than random. Pose prediction was also quite challenging, in part because inhibitors in the set bind to three different sites, so even identifying the correct binding site was challenging. Still, the best methods managed low root mean squared deviation predictions in many cases. Here, we give an overview of results, highlight some features of methods which worked particularly well, and refer the interested reader to papers in this issue which describe specific submissions for additional details.},

This computational blind challenge involved predicting protein-ligand binding against the three allosteric sites of HIV integrase (IN), a viral enzyme for which two drugs (that target the active site) have been approved by the FDA. Positive control cross-docking experiments were utilized to select 13 receptor models out of an initial ensemble of 41 different crystal structures of HIV IN. These 13 models of the targets were selected using our new "Rank Difference Ratio" metric. The first stage of SAMPL4 involved using virtual screens to identify 62 active, allosteric IN inhibitors out of a set of 321 compounds. The second stage involved predicting the binding site(s) and crystallographic binding mode(s) for 57 of these inhibitors. Our team submitted four entries for the first stage that utilized: (1) AutoDock Vina (AD Vina) plus visual inspection; (2) a new common pharmacophore engine; (3) BEDAM replica exchange free energy simulations, and a Consensus approach that combined the predictions of all three strategies. Even with the SAMPL4's very challenging compound library that displayed a significantly lower amount of structural diversity than most libraries that are conventionally employed in prospective virtual screens, these approaches produced hit rates of 24, 25, 34, and 27 %, respectively, on a set with 19 % declared binders. Our only entry for the second stage challenge was based on the results of AD Vina plus visual inspection, and it ranked third place overall according to several different metrics provided by the SAMPL4 organizers. The successful results displayed by these approaches highlight the utility of the computational structure-based drug discovery tools and strategies that are being developed to advance the goals of the newly created, multi-institution, NIH-funded center called the "HIV Interaction and Viral Evolution Center".},

Another fragment, 3-indolepropionic acid (1F1-N), predicted by AutoDock calculations and confirmed in a novel inhibition of nucleation crystallization assay, exploits the same interactions in the flap site in two crystal structures. Both 1F1 and 1F1-N bind to the closed form of apo-PR and to pepstatin:PR. In solution, 1F1 and 1F1-N raise the Tm of apo-PR by 3.5-5 °C as assayed by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) and show equivalent low-micromolar binding constants to both apo-PR and pepstatin:PR, assayed by backscattering interferometry (BSI). The observed signal intensities in BSI are greater for each fragment upon binding to apo-PR than to pepstatin-bound PR, consistent with greater conformational change in the former binding event. Together, these data indicate that fragment binding in the flap site favors a closed conformation of HIV PR.},

However, the use of coxibs, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), was discontinued because of the high risk of cardiovascular adverse events. More recent clinical findings highlighted how the cardiovascular toxicity of coxibs could be mitigated by an appropriate COX-1 versus COX-2 selectivity. We previously reported a set of substituted 1,5-diarylpyrrole derivatives, selective for COX-2.

  abstract        = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase is one of three virally encoded enzymes essential for replication and, therefore, a rational choice as a drug target for the treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals. In 2007, raltegravir became the first integrase inhibitor approved for use in the treatment of HIV-infected patients, more than a decade since the approval of the first protease inhibitor (saquinavir, Hoffman La-Roche, 1995) and two decades since the approval of the first reverse transcriptase inhibitor (retrovir, GlaxoSmithKline, 1987). The slow progress toward a clinically effective HIV-1 integrase inhibitor can at least in part be attributed to a poor structural understanding of this key viral protein. Here we describe the development of a restrained molecular dynamics protocol that produces a more accurate model of the active site of this drug target. This model provides an advance on previously described models as it ensures that the catalytic DDE motif makes correct, monodentate interactions with the two active-site magnesium ions. Dynamic restraints applied to this coordination state create models with the correct solvation sphere for the metal ion complex and highlight the coordination sites available for metal-binding ligands. Application of appropriate dynamic flexibility to the core domain allowed the inclusion of multiple conformational states in subsequent docking studies. These models have allowed us to (1) explore the effects of key drug resistance mutations on the dynamic flexibility and conformational preferences of HIV integrase and to (2) study raltegravir binding in the context of these dynamic models of both wild type and the G140S/Q148H drug-resistant enzyme.},

  abstract     = {Tubulin targeting agents constitute an important class of anticancer drugs. By acting either as microtubule stabilizers or destabilizers, they disrupt microtubule dynamics, thus inducing mitotic arrest and, ultimately, cell death by apoptosis. Three different binding sites, whose exact location on tubulin has been experimentally detected, have been identified so far for antimitotic compound targeting microtubules, namely the taxoid, the colchicine and the vinka alkaloid binding site. A number of ligand- and structure-based molecular modeling studies in this field has been reported over the years, aimed at elucidating the binding modes of both stabilizing and destabilizing agent, as well as the molecular features responsible for their efficacious interaction with tubulin. Such studies are described in this review, focusing on information provided by different modeling approaches on the structural determinants of antitubulin agents and the interactions with the binding pockets on tubulin emerged as fundamental for antitumor activity.To describe molecular modeling approaches applied to date to molecules known to bind microtubules, this paper has been divided into two main parts: microtubule destabilizing (Part 1) and stabilizing (Part 2) agents. The first part includes structure-based and ligand-based approaches to study molecules targeting colchicine (1.1) and vinca alkaloid (1.2) binding sites, respectively. In the second part, the studies performed on microtubule-stabilizing antimitotic agents (MSAA) are described. Starting from the first representative compound of this class, paclitaxel, molecular modeling studies (quantitative structure-activity relationships - QSAR - and structure-based approaches), performed on natural compounds acting with the same mechanism of action and temptative common pharmacophoric hypotheses for all of these compounds, are reported.},

A combination of docking and dynamics calculations allowed us to build three-dimensional models of the complexes between Src and several of its known inhibitors. Interactions most contributing to activity of the inhibitors, in terms of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts, were codified into pharmacophoric models that were in turn applied to perform a search of commercially available compounds within the Asinex database. As a result, we identified 1,3,4-thiadiazoles and pyrazolydine-3,5-diones showing inhibitory activity in the submicromolar range in a cell-free assay toward Src. Moreover, since several of the compounds used to generate pharmacophores were also known as Abl inhibitors, we tested the identified hits toward Abl tyrosine kinase, finding activity in the submicromolar range. Such biological data suggested that the computational protocol is an efficient tool for identifying new hits toward both Src and Abl.},

While starting by summarizing the key concepts in protein-ligand docking, this article presents an analysis of the evolution of this important field of research over the past decade. Particular attention is given to the massive range of alternatives, in terms of protein-ligand docking software programs currently available. The emerging trends in this field are the subject of special attention, while old established docking alternatives are critically revisited. Current challenges in the field of protein-ligand docking such as the treatment of protein flexibility, the presence of structural water molecules and its effect in docking, and the entropy of binding are dissected and discussed, trying to anticipate the next years in the field.},

Despite great advances and successful applications in recent years, a number of issues remain unsolved. Most of the challenges and problems faced when running docking experiments are independent of the specific software used, and can be ascribed to either improper input preparation or to the simplified approaches applied to achieve high-throughput speed. Being aware of approximations and limitations of such methods is essential to prevent errors, deal with misleading results, and increase the success rate of virtual screening campaigns. In this review, best practices and most common issues of docking and virtual screening will be discussed, covering the journey from the design of the virtual experiment to the hit identification.},

Although, their chemical structure, simpler than taxanes, makes them more suitable for derivatization. Their interesting pharmacokinetic and bioavailabilty profiles, and the activity against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines make them interesting therapeutic agents. Here a brief historical perspective of epothilones is presented, since their isolation, the identification of their mechanism of action and activity, to the recent clinical trials.},

  abstract  = {Fluctuation X-ray scattering is a biophysical structural characterization technique that overcomes low data-to-parameter ratios encountered in traditional X-ray methods used for studying noncrystalline samples. By collecting a series of ultrashort X-ray exposures on an ensemble of particles at a free-electron laser, information-dense experimental data can be extracted that ultimately result in structures with a greater level of detail than can be obtained using traditional X-ray scattering methods. In this article we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this technique by introducing data-processing techniques and advanced noise-filtering methods that reduce the required data collection time to less than a few minutes. This will ultimately allow one to visualize details of structural dynamics that may be inaccessible through traditional methods.Fluctuation X-ray scattering (FXS) is an emerging experimental technique in which X-ray solution scattering data are collected from particles in solution using ultrashort X-ray exposures generated by a free-electron laser (FEL). FXS experiments overcome the low data-to-parameter ratios associated with traditional solution scattering measurements by providing several orders of magnitude more information in the final processed data. Here we demonstrate the practical feasibility of FEL-based FXS on a biological multiple-particle system and describe data-processing techniques required to extract robust FXS data and significantly reduce the required number of snapshots needed by introducing an iterative noise-filtering technique. We showcase a successful ab initio electron density reconstruction from such an experiment, studying the Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus (PBCV-1).},

  abstract  = {For direct phasing of protein crystals, a method based on the hybrid-input-output (HIO) algorithm has been proposed and tested on a variety of structures. 
So far, however, the diffraction data have been limited to high-resolution ones, i.e., higher than 2 Å. In principle, the methodology can be applied to data of lower resolutions, 
which might be particularly useful for phasing membrane protein crystals. For resolutions higher than 3.5 Å, it seems the atomic structure is solvable. 
For data of lower resolutions, information of the secondary structures and the protein boundary can still be obtained. 
Examples are given to support the conclusions. Real experimental data are used. 
Two aspects of the observed data have been discussed: removal of the measured low-resolution reflections and involvement of the unmeasured high-resolution reflections. 
The ab initio phasing employs histogram matching for density modification. 
A question arises whether the reference histogram used should match the resolution of the diffraction data or not. 
It seems that there is an optimal histogram which is good to use for data at various resolutions.},

For proper NCS, when the NCS axis is positioned, the molecular envelope can be automatically rebuilt. For improper NCS, when the NCS axis and the translation vector are known, the molecular envelope can also be automatically reconstructed. Some structures with a solvent content of around 50% could be directly solved using this ab initio phasing method. Trial calculations are described to illustrate the methodology. Real diffraction data are used and the calculated phases are good for automatic model building. The refinement of approximate NCS parameters is discussed.},

The good global convergence properties of these algorithms, coupled with the spherical shape and high structural redundancy of icosahedral viruses, allows high resolution phases to be determined with no initial phase information. This approach is demonstrated by determining the electron density of a virus crystal with 5-fold non-crystallographic symmetry, starting with only a spherical shell envelope. The electron density obtained is sufficiently accurate for model building. The results indicate that iterative projection algorithms should be routinely applicable in virus crystallography, without the need for ancillary phase information.},

The binary constraint is sufficient to overcome the undersampling and enforce uniqueness, but is insufficient in the case of the additional loss of data that can occur in practice. An iterative projection algorithm is developed that uses binary, connectivity, and compactness constraints to solve the image reconstruction problem. Simulations show the utility of the reconstruction algorithm.},

  abstract  = {Several strategies in phase retrieval are unified by an iterative ``difference map'' constructed from a pair of elementary projections and three real parameters. For the standard application in optics, where the two projections implement Fourier modulus and object support constraints, respectively, the difference map reproduces the ``hybrid'' form of Fienup's input--output map when a particular choice is made for two of the parameters. The geometric construction of the difference map illuminates the distinction between its fixed points and the recovered object, as well as the mechanism whereby the form of stagnation encountered by alternating projection schemes is avoided. When support constraints are replaced by object histogram or atomicity constraints, the difference map lends itself to crystallographic phase retrieval. Numerical experiments with synthetic data suggest that structures with hundreds of atoms can be solved.},

In addition to identifying useful innovations that have come into general use through their implementation in {\it SHELX}, a critical analysis is presented of the less-successful features, missed opportunities and desirable improvements for future releases of the software. An attempt is made to understand how a program originally designed for photographic intensity data, punched cards and computers over 10000 times slower than an average modern personal computer has managed to survive for~so~long. {\it SHELXL} is the most widely used program for small-molecule refinement and {\it SHELXS} and {\it SHELXD} are often employed for structure solution despite the availability of objectively superior programs. {\it SHELXL} also finds a niche for the refinement of macromolecules against high-resolution or twinned data; {\it SHELXPRO} acts as an interface for macromolecular applications. {\it SHELXC}, {\it SHELXD} and {\it SHELXE} are proving useful for the experimental phasing of macromolecules, especially because they are fast and robust and so are often employed in pipelines for {\it high-throughput} phasing. This paper could serve as a general literature citation when one or more of the open-source {\it SHELX} programs (and the Bruker AXS version {\it SHELXTL}) are employed in the course of a crystal-structure determination.},

For use in a phasing procedure, this information can be formulated as a selection criterion (figure of merit) which assigns a reliability weight to every trial phase set and distinguishes the closest ones to the true phase set. Different types of additional information may be tested as a selection criterion: electron-density histograms, connectivity properties, statistical likelihood, atomicity {\it etc}. A common feature of such criteria is that they do not unambiguously judge the phase quality at low resolution. Nevertheless, the selection of the phase sets with best criterion values increases the ratio of good phase sets in the ensemble considered. An approximate solution of the phase problem may then be found by averaging the selected phase sets. Cluster analysis of the selected phase sets and averaging within clusters allow further improvement of this solution.},

Use of a Monte-Carlo type computer procedure is suggested to choose between the possible phase sets. It consists of generating a large number of pseudo-atom models inside the mask defined by a trial phase set and the use of histograms of magnitude correlation to evaluate the masks. It is shown that the procedure may be considered as a generalization of the statistical maximum-likelihood principle and may be used as a powerful supplementary tool in the likelihood-based approaches to the phase problem solution.},

A{\bf 50}, 609{--}621], a direct-phasing process was described which proved to be potentially able to solve {\it ab initio} crystal structures of proteins. The method uses the diffraction data of the native and of one isomorphous derivative. The main limitation of the approach was the small number of phased reflections rather than the quality of the assigned phases. In this paper, it is shown that the phasing process can be extended to about 40% of the measured reflections (up to the derivative resolution) without reducing significantly the quality of the new phases. Of the four test proteins examined, in one case it was possible to obtain fully interpretable electron-density maps.},

Quantumcrysca is an innovative attempt to calculatethe energy in periodical systems by quantum-mechanicalmeans including full treatment of space group symmetryusing a QM-MM-approach. Dividing the crystal in disjunctspherical regions gives rise to a shell-model. All interactionsbetween atoms in the inner sphere are treated on a quantummechanical level, whereas the interactions in the outer sphereand between the inner and the outer sphere are calculated byclassical force-fields.

First efforts have been made by Neumann et. al. usingplane wave DFT-D in periodical systems.3 InQuantumcrysca the quantum-mechanical sphere isefficiently described using localised orbitals (Gaussian typeorbital, GTO), leading to a massive saving of computing timeand a more intuitive view of the electronic state usingmolecular orbitals.

In Quantumcrysca various local optimizationalgorithms using analytical derivatives are implemented, including steepest-descent, conjugate-gradient andquasi-Newton-methods. Faster convergence is achieved byadditional linesearch in each optimization step. 

The combination of these local optimization techniqueswith a structure-generation algorithm can be used to perform a complete crystal structure prediction in the absence ofexperimental data.

Quantumcrysca is designed for the validation ofcrystal structures as well as for the performance of a fullcrystal structure prediction. First results will be presented.},

  note     = {Pubmed PMID: 30101566},
  abstract = {RNA editing causes massive remodeling of the mitochondrial mRNA transcriptome in trypanosomes and related kinetoplastid protozoa. This type of editing involves the specific insertion or deletion of uridylates (U) directed by small noncoding guide RNAs (gRNAs). Because U-insertion exceeds U-deletion by a factor of 10, editing increases the nascent mRNA size by up to 55%. In Trypanosoma brucei, the editing apparatus uses ~40 proteins and >1,200 gRNAs to create the functional open reading frame in 12 mRNAs. Thousands of sites are specifically recognized in the pre-edited mRNAs and a myriad of partially edited transcript intermediates accumulates in mitochondria. The control of editing is poorly understood, but past work suggests that it occurs during substrate recognition, the initiation and progression of editing, and during the life-cycle in different hosts. The growing understanding of the editing proteins offers clues about editing control. Most editing proteins reside in the "RNA-free" RNA editing core complex (RECC) and in the accessory RNA editing substrate complex (RESC) that contains gRNA. Two accessory RNA helicases are known, including one in the RNA editing helicase 2 complex (REH2C). Both the RESC and the REH2C associate with mRNA, providing a rationale for the assembly of mRNA or its mRNPs, RESC, and the RECC enzyme. Identified variants of the canonical editing complexes further complicate the model of RNA editing. We examine specific examples of complex variants, differential effects of editing proteins on the mRNAs within and between T. brucei life stages, and possible control points in RNA holo-editosomes.

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics with explicit solvent is favored for its ability to more correctly simulate aqueous biological processes and has become routine thanks to increasingly powerful computational resources. However, analysis techniques including Markov state models (MSMs) ignore solvent atoms and focus solely on solute coordinates despite solvent being implicated in myriad biological phenomena. We present a unified framework called “solvent-shells featurization” for including solvent degrees of freedom in analysis and show that this method produces better models. We apply this method to simulations of dewetting in the two-domain protein BphC to generate a predictive MSM and identify functional water molecules. Furthermore, the proposed methodology could be easily extended for building MSMs of any systems with indistinguishable components.},

  abstract  = {Popular neural networks for image-processing problems often contain many different operations, multiple layers of connections, and a large number of trainable parameters, often exceeding several million. They are typically tailored to specific applications, making it difficult to apply a network that is successful in one application to different applications. Here, we introduce a neural network architecture that is less complex than existing networks, is easy to train, and achieves accurate results with relatively few trainable parameters. The network automatically adapts to a specific problem, allowing the same network to be applied to a wide variety of different problems.Deep convolutional neural networks have been successfully applied to many image-processing problems in recent works. Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.},

  abstract = {Design of experiments (DOE) is an established methodology in research, development, manufacturing, and production for screening, optimization, and robustness testing. Two-level fractional factorial designs remain the preferred approach due to high information content while keeping the number of experiments low. These types of designs, however, have never been extended to a generalized multilevel reduced design type that would be capable to include both qualitative and quantitative factors. In this Article we describe a novel generalized fractional factorial design. In addition, it also provides complementary and balanced subdesigns analogous to a fold-over in two-level reduced factorial designs. We demonstrate how this design type can be applied with good results in three different applications in analytical chemistry including (a) multivariate calibration using microwave resonance spectroscopy for the determination of water in tablets, (b) stability study in drug product development, and (c) representative sample selection in clinical studies. This demonstrates the potential of generalized fractional factorial designs to be applied in many other areas of analytical chemistry where representative, balanced, and complementary subsets are required, especially when a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors at multiple levels exists.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The general problem is considered of choosing a design such that (a) the polynomial f(ξ) = f(ξ1, ξ2, · · ·, ξ k ) in the k continuous variables ξ' = (ξ1, ξ2, · · ·, ξ k ) fitted by the method of least squares most closely represents the true function g(ξ1, ξ2, · · ·, ξ k ) over some “region of interest” R in the ξ space, no restrictions being introduced that the experimental points should necessarily lie inside R; and (b) subject to satisfaction of (a), there is a high chance that inadequacy of f(ξ) to represent g(ξ) will be detected. When the observations are subject to error, discrepancies between the fitted polynomial and the true function occur: i. due to sampling error (called here “variance error”), and ii. due to the inadequacy of the polynomial f(ξ) exactly to represent g(ξ) (called here “bias error”). To meet requirement (a) the design is selected so as to minimize J, the expected mean square error averaged over the region R. J contains two components, one associated entirely with variance error and the other associated entirely with bias error. There is a class of designs which satisfy requirement (a). To meet requirement (b) we select from this class a subclass for which the “non-centrality term” in the expectation of the residual sum of squares in the analysis of variance is large. This leads to a sensitive test of goodness of fit. In this paper the theory is applied to the particular case where f(ξ) is a polynomial of first degree and g(ξ) a polynomial of second degree; that is, the experimenter is hopefully fitting a first degree equation over the region R in the circumstances where the true function is really quadratic. The somewhat unexpected conclusion is reached that, at least in the cases considered, the optimal design in typical situations in which both variance and bias occur is very nearly the same as would be obtained if variance were ignored completely and the experiment designed so as to minimize bias alone. Particular examples of the class of optimal designs derived are fractional by replicated two-level factorial designs (in which no two-factor interaction is confounded with the main effect) with added center points.

As a consequence, they miss opportunities to present quantities that are of greatest substantive interest for their research and express the appropriate degree of certainty about these quantities. In this article, we offer an approach, built on the technique of statistical simulation, to extract the currently overlooked information from any statistical method and to interpret and present it in a reader-friendly manner. Using this technique requires some expertise, which we try to provide herein, but its application should make the results of quantitative articles more informative and transparent. To illustrate our recommendations, we replicate the results of several published works, showing in each case how the authors{\textquoteright} own conclusions can be expressed more sharply and informatively, and, without changing any data or statistical assumptions, how our approach reveals important new information about the research questions at hand. We also offer very easy-to-use Clarify software that implements our suggestions.},

  abstract = {Using X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), it is possible to determine three-dimensional structures of nanoscale particles using single-particle imaging methods. Classification algorithms are needed to sort out the single-particle diffraction patterns from the large amount of XFEL experimental data. However, different methods often yield inconsistent results. This study compared the performance of three classification algorithms: convolutional neural network, graph cut and diffusion map manifold embedding methods. The identified single-particle diffraction data of the PR772 virus particles were assembled in the three-dimensional Fourier space for real-space model reconstruction. The comparison showed that these three classification methods lead to different datasets and subsequently result in different electron density maps of the reconstructed models. Interestingly, the common dataset selected by these three methods improved the quality of the merged diffraction volume, as well as the resolutions of the reconstructed maps.},

  abstract  = {Iterative projection algorithms (IPAs) are a promising tool for protein crystallographic phase determination. Although related to traditional density-modification algorithms, IPAs have better convergence properties, and, as a result, can effectively overcome the phase problem given modest levels of structural redundancy. This is illustrated by applying IPAs to determine the electron densities of two protein crystals with fourfold non-crystallographic symmetry, starting with only the experimental diffraction amplitudes, a low-resolution molecular envelope and the position of the non-crystallographic axes. The algorithm returns electron densities that are sufficiently accurate for model building, allowing automated recovery of the known structures. This study indicates that IPAs should find routine application in protein crystallography, being capable of reconstructing electron densities starting with very little initial phase information.},

This makes it difficult to objectively judge the precision of the structures. We used Bayesian inference to derive a probability distribution that represents the unknown structure and its precision. This probability distribution also determines additional unknowns, such as theory parameters, that previously had to be chosen empirically. We implemented this approach by using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Our method provides an objective figure of merit and improves structural quality.},

  abstract = {The transferable aspherical pseudoatom data bank, UBDB2018, is extended with over 130 new atom types present in small and biological molecules of great importance in biology and chemistry. UBDB2018 can be applied either as a source of aspherical atomic scattering factors in a standard X-ray experiment ({\it d}${\sb min}$ {$\simeq$} 0.8{\AA}) instead of the independent atom model (IAM), and can therefore enhance the final crystal structure geometry and refinement parameters; or as a tool to reconstruct the molecular charge-density distribution and derive the electrostatic properties of chemical systems for which 3D structural data are available. The extended data bank has been extensively tested, with the focus being on the accuracy of the molecular electrostatic potential computed for important drug-like molecules, namely the HIV-1 protease inhibitors. The UBDB allows the reconstruction of the reference B3LYP/6-31G** potentials, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.015ebohr${\sp {$-$}1}$ computed for entire potential grids which span values from {\it ca} 200ebohr${\sp {$-$}1}$ to {\it ca} {$-$}0.1ebohr${\sp {$-$}1}$ and encompass both the inside and outside regions of a molecule. UBDB2018 is shown to be applicable to enhancing the physical meaning of the molecular electrostatic potential descriptors used to construct predictive quantitative structure{--}activity relationship/quantitative structure{--}property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) models for drug discovery studies. In addition, it is suggested that electron structure factors computed from UBDB2018 may significantly improve the interpretation of electrostatic potential maps measured experimentally by means of electron diffraction or single-particle cryo-EM methods.},

  abstract = {A semiparametric regression model of a q-dimensional multivariate response y on a p-dimensional covariate x is considered. A new approach is proposed based on sliced inverse regression (SIR) for estimating the effective dimension reduction (EDR) space without requiring a prespecified parametric model. The convergence at rate n of the estimated EDR space is shown. The choice of the dimension of the EDR space is discussed. Moreover, a way to cluster components of y related to the same EDR space is provided. Thus, the proposed multivariate SIR method can be used properly on each cluster instead of blindly applying it on all components of y. The numerical performances of multivariate SIR are illustrated on a simulation study. An application to the Minneapolis elementary schools data is also provided. Although the proposed methodology relies on SIR, it opens the door for new regression approaches with a multivariate response. They could be built similarly based on other reduction dimension methods.},

Our submitted predictions ranked relatively well compared to the submissions from other participants. Here we present our methodologies used in the challenge. For the binding pose prediction, we employed the Glide module in the Schrodinger Suite 2017 and AutoDock Vina. For the binding affinity/free energy prediction, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes in explicit water solvent with counter ions, and then estimated the binding free energies with our newly developed model of extended linear interaction energy (ELIE), which is inspired by two other popular end-point approaches: the linear interaction energy (LIE) method, and the molecular mechanics with Poisson--Boltzmann surface area solvation method (MM/PBSA). Our studies suggest that ELIE is a good trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, and it is appropriate for filling the gap between the high-throughput docking and scoring methods and the rigorous but much more computationally demanding methods like free energy perturbation (FEP) or thermodynamics integration (TI) in computer-aided drug design (CADD) projects.},

Although scientific workflow systems can powerfully organize and execute large-scale data-analysis processes, creating and maintaining such workflows usually comes with nontrivial learning curves and engineering overhead, making them cumbersome to use for everyday data exploration and prototyping. To bridge the gap between interactive analysis and workflow systems, we developed Script of Scripts (SoS), an interactive data-analysis platform and workflow system with a strong emphasis on readability, practicality, and reproducibility in daily computational research. For exploratory analysis, SoS has a multilanguage scripting format that centralizes otherwise-scattered scripts and creates dynamic reports for publication and sharing. As a workflow engine, SoS provides an intuitive syntax for creating workflows in process-oriented, outcome-oriented, and mixed styles, as well as a unified interface for executing and managing tasks on a variety of computing platforms with automatic synchronization of files among isolated file systems. As illustrated herein by real-world examples, SoS is both an interactive analysis tool and pipeline platform suitable for different stages of method development and data-analysis projects. In particular, SoS can be easily adopted in existing data analysis routines to substantially improve organization, readability, and cross-platform computation management of research projects.},

  abstract = {Here, we examine the thermodynamic penalty arising from burial of a polar group in a hydrophobic pocket that forms part of the binding-site of the major urinary protein (MUP-I). X-ray crystal structures of the complexes of octanol, nonanol and 1,8 octan-diol indicate that these ligands bind with similar orientations in the binding pocket. Each complex is characterised by a bridging water molecule between the hydroxyl group of Tyr120 and the hydroxyl group of each ligand. The additional hydroxyl group of 1,8 octan-diol is thereby forced to reside in a hydrophobic pocket, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments indicate that this is accompanied by a standard free energy penalty of +21 kJ/mol with respect to octanol and +18 kJ/mol with respect to nonanol. Consideration of the solvation thermodynamics of each ligand enables the “intrinsic” (solute–solute) interaction energy to be determined, which indicates a favourable enthalpic component and an entropic component that is small or zero. These data indicate that the thermodynamic penalty to binding derived from the unfavourable desolvation of 1,8 octan-diol is partially offset by a favourable intrinsic contribution. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that this latter contribution derives from favourable solute–solute dispersion interactions.},

  abstract    = {Recent research suggests that rates of extreme poverty, commonly defined as living on less than $2/person/day, are high and rising in the United States. We re-examine the rate of extreme poverty by linking 2011 data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and Current Population Survey, the sources of recent extreme poverty estimates, to administrative tax and program data. Of the 3.6 million non-homeless households with survey-reported cash income below $2/person/day, we find that more than 90% are not in extreme poverty once we include in-kind transfers, replace survey reports of earnings and transfer receipt with administrative records, and account for the ownership of substantial assets. More than half of all misclassified households have incomes from the administrative data above the poverty line, and several of the largest misclassified groups appear to be at least middle class based on measures of material well-being. In contrast, the households kept from extreme poverty by in-kind transfers appear to be among the most materially deprived Americans. Nearly 80% of all misclassified households are initially categorized as extreme poor due to errors or omissions in reports of cash income. Of the households remaining in extreme poverty, 90% consist of a single individual. An implication of the low recent extreme poverty rate is that it cannot be substantially higher now due to welfare reform, as many commentators have claimed.},

  abstract  = {Summary: Complex formation and conformational transitions of biological macromolecules in solution can be effectively studied using the information about overall shape and size provided by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Hybrid modeling is often applied to integrate high-resolution models into SAXS data analysis. To facilitate this task, we present SASpy, a PyMOL plugin that provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for SAXS-based hybrid modeling. Through a few mouse clicks in SASpy, low-resolution models can be superimposed to high-resolution structures, theoretical scattering profiles and fits can be calculated and displayed on-the-fly. Mouse-based manual rearrangements of complexes are conveniently applied to rapidly check and interactively refine tentative models. Interfaces to automated rigid-body and flexible refinement of macromolecular models against the experimental SAXS data are provided.Availability: SASpy is available as open source at: github.com/emblsaxs/saspy/.

both PyMOL (www.pymol.org) and ATSAS (www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/download.html) are required.Contact: apanjkovich@embl-hamburg.de, svergun@embl-hamburg.de},

  abstract  = {Phasing of nucleic acid crystal diffraction data using the anomalous signal of phosphorus, P-SAD, at Cukα wavelength has been previously demonstrated using Z-DNA. Since the original work on P-SAD with Z-DNA there has been, with a notable exception, a conspicuous absence of applications of the technique to additional nucleic acid crystal structures. We have reproduced the P-SAD phasing of Z-DNA using a rotating-anode source and have attempted to phase a variety of nucleic acid crystals using P-SAD without success. A comparison of P-SAD using Z-DNA and a representative nucleic acid, the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer, is presented along with a S-SAD using only two sulfurs to phase a 2’-thio modified DNA decamer. A theoretical explanation for the limitation of P-SAD applied to nucleic acids is presented to show that the relatively high atomic displacement parameter of phosphorus in the nucleic acid backbone is responsible for the lack of success in applying P-SAD to nucleic acid diffraction data.},
  annote    = {I spent an hour reading the paper by Joel Harp and Martin Egli of the failure of of P-phasing of B-form DNA. I had selected as an example paper from Crystals. This is a surprisingly good paper. Of course, this paper meets Martin Egli's standard of excellence. This paper does describe their success at P-SAD phasing an RNA with two sulfurs incorporated. They also have success at Direct Methods with SIR2004 but they did not mention success with shelxd. Their analysis was extensive of relative phosphorous mobility is heroic. They even attempted 10,000 structure determination with ShelxE! This paper is very relevant to my PSAD and ISAD phasing paper. Their introduction has an excellent description of why nucleic acids are difficult to derivative. They also compare delta B of sulfur and phosphorous atoms versus the light atoms for proteins and nucleic acids. They found that sulfurs in proteins on average have lower B-values while phosphorous atoms in nucleic acids have higher B-values. They attribute the failure to the greater mobility of the phosphates compared to the other atoms as assessed from the B-values. I suspect that A-form helices will show less mobility in the phosphates. They also have a nice review of progress with XFELS.},

  abstract        = {Zinc is present in a wide variety of proteins and is important in the metabolism of most organisms. Zinc metalloenzymes are therapeutically relevant targets in diseases such as cancer, heart disease, bacterial infection, and Alzheimer's disease. In most cases a drug molecule targeting such enzymes establishes an interaction that coordinates with the zinc ion. Thus, accurate prediction of the interaction of ligands with zinc is an important aspect of computational docking and virtual screening against zinc containing proteins. We have extended the AutoDock force field to include a specialized potential describing the interactions of zinc-coordinating ligands. This potential describes both the energetic and geometric components of the interaction. The new force field, named AutoDock4Zn, was calibrated on a data set of 292 crystal complexes containing zinc. Redocking experiments show that the force field provides significant improvement in performance in both free energy of binding estimation as well as in root-mean-square deviation from the crystal structure pose. The new force field has been implemented in AutoDock without modification to the source code.},

  abstract = {The composition of protein surfaces determines both affinity and specificity of protein-protein interactions. Matching of hydrophobic contacts and charged groups on both sites of the interface are crucial to ensure specificity. Here, we propose a highlighting scheme, YRB, which highlights both hydrophobicity and charge in protein structures. YRB highlighting visualizes hydrophobicity by highlighting all carbon atoms that are not bound to nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The charged oxygens of glutamate and aspartate are highlighted red and the charged nitrogens of arginine and lysine are highlighted blue. For a set of representative examples, we demonstrate that YRB highlighting intuitively visualizes segments on protein surfaces that contribute to specificity in protein-protein interfaces, including Hsp90/co-chaperone complexes, the SNARE complex and a transmembrane domain. We provide YRB highlighting in form of a script that runs using the software PyMOL.},

  abstract  = {Due to computational challenges and non-availability of conjugate prior distributions, Bayesian variable selection in quantile regression models is often a difficult task. In this paper, we address these two issues for quantile regression models. In particular, we develop an informative stochastic search variable selection (ISSVS) for quantile regression models that introduces an informative prior distribution. We adopt prior structures which incorporate historical data into the current data by quantifying them with a suitable prior distribution on the model parameters. This allows ISSVS to search more efficiently in the model space and choose the more likely models. In addition, a Gibbs sampler is derived to facilitate the computation of the posterior probabilities. A major advantage of ISSVS is that it avoids instability in the posterior estimates for the Gibbs sampler as well as convergence problems that may arise from choosing vague priors. Finally, the proposed methods are illustrated with both simulation and real data.},

  abstract  = {Chemical space is so large that brute force searches for new interesting molecules are infeasible. High-throughput virtual screening via computer cluster simulations can speed up the discovery process by collecting very large amounts of data in parallel, e.g., up to hundreds or thousands of parallel measurements. Bayesian optimization (BO) can produce additional acceleration by sequentially identifying the most useful simulations or experiments to be performed next. However, current BO methods cannot scale to the large numbers of parallel measurements and the massive libraries of molecules currently used in high-throughput screening. Here, we propose a scalable solution based on a parallel and distributed implementation of Thompson sampling (PDTS). We show that, in small scale problems, PDTS performs similarly as parallel expected improvement (EI), a batch version of the most widely used BO heuristic. Additionally, in settings where parallel EI does not scale, PDTS outperforms other scalable baselines such as a greedy search, $\epsilon$-greedy approaches and a random search method. These results show that PDTS is a successful solution for large-scale parallel BO.},

  abstract       = {Adaptation and survival of Trypanosoma brucei requires editing of mitochondrial mRNA by uridylate (U) insertion and deletion. Hundreds of small guide RNAs (gRNAs) direct the mRNA editing at over 3,000 sites. RNA editing is controlled during the life cycle but the regulation of substrate and stage specificity remains unknown. Editing progresses in the 3' to 5' direction along the pre-mRNA in blocks, each targeted by a unique gRNA. A critical editing factor is the mitochondrial RNA binding complex 1 (MRB1) that binds gRNA and transiently interacts with the catalytic RNA editing core complex (RECC). MRB1 is a large and dynamic complex that appears to be comprised of distinct but related subcomplexes (termed here MRBs). MRBs seem to share a 'core' complex of proteins but differ in the composition of the 'variable' proteins. Since some proteins associate transiently the MRBs remain imprecisely defined. MRB1 controls editing by unknown mechanisms, and the functional relevance of the different MRBs is unclear. We previously identified two distinct MRBs, and showed that they carry mRNAs that undergo editing. We proposed that editing takes place in the MRBs because MRBs stably associate with mRNA and gRNA but only transiently interact with RECC, which is RNA free. Here, we identify the first specialized functions in MRBs: 1) 3010-MRB is a major scaffold for RNA editing, and 2) REH2-MRB contains a critical trans-acting RNA helicase (REH2) that affects multiple steps of editing function in 3010-MRB. These trans effects of the REH2 include loading of unedited mRNA and editing in the first block and in subsequent blocks as editing progresses. REH2 binds its own MRB via RNA, and conserved domains in REH2 were critical for REH2 to associate with the RNA and protein components of its MRB. Importantly, REH2 associates with a ~30 kDa RNA-binding protein in a novel ~15S subcomplex in RNA-depleted mitochondria. We use these new results to update our model of MRB function and organization.},

  abstract  = {We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM).},

to prior mass. The evidence (alternatively the marginal likelihood, marginal density

It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of
numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional byproduct,
obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within
a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing
methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the “nested” contours of
likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic relabelling)
allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which
effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

  abstract  = {Markov (state) models (MSMs) and related models of molecular kinetics have recently received a surge of interest as they can systematically reconcile simulation data from either a few long or many short simulations and allow us to analyze the essential metastable structures, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the molecular system under investigation. However, the estimation, validation, and analysis of such models is far from trivial and involves sophisticated and often numerically sensitive methods. In this work we present the open-source Python package PyEMMA (http://pyemma.org) that provides accurate and efficient algorithms for kinetic model construction. PyEMMA can read all common molecular dynamics data formats, helps in the selection of input features, provides easy access to dimension reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) and clustering algorithms such as k-means, and contains estimators for MSMs, hidden Markov models, and several other models. Systematic model validation and error calculation methods are provided. PyEMMA offers a wealth of analysis functions such that the user can conveniently compute molecular observables of interest. We have derived a systematic and accurate way to coarse-grain MSMs to few states and to illustrate the structures of the metastable states of the system. Plotting functions to produce a manuscript-ready presentation of the results are available. In this work, we demonstrate the features of the software and show new methodological concepts and results produced by PyEMMA.},

  abstract  = {In experimental research referencing two or more measurements to one another is a powerful tool to reduce the effect of systematic errors between different sets of measurements. The interesting quantity is usually derived from two measurements on the same sample under different conditions. While an elaborate experimental design is essential for improving the estimate, the data analysis should also maximally exploit the covariance between the measurements. In X-ray crystallography the difference between structure-factor amplitudes carries important information to solve experimental phasing problems or to determine time-dependent structural changes in pump{--}probe experiments. Here a multivariate Bayesian method was used to analyse intensity measurement pairs to determine their underlying structure-factor amplitudes and their differences. The posterior distribution of the model parameter was approximated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The described merging method is shown to be especially advantageous when systematic and random errors result in recording negative intensity measurements.},
  annote    = {They used pyMC3. The NUTS sampler was unstable with this problem, so they abandoned it. Their optimistic comments about other approximate Bayeisan approaches belie their ignorance. I now think that the way forward is to apply an observation model to the negative intensities problem and a state model to for the expected values. According to Randy Read, the problem with the Wilson and French approach with weak data is that the Wilson distriubiton used for the prior dominates. Maybe a Heirarchical model would do the trick because a different prior could be used or maybe an objective Bayesian approach could be take where the prior differs for each reflection. Another approach would be to toss out the weak data and the determine the substructure with strongest differences. You only need several hundred reflections. So how do you handle the situation of merging multiple observations? Katona is the PI. He has a half dozen people in his group. Their basic idea was to treat the F1 and F2 as part of a bivariate joint normal distribution. I tried to reproduce their work in R on 8 August 2016. See my 750words entry.},

  abstract  = {We assess the ability of our convolutional neural network (CNN)-based scoring functions to perform several common tasks in the domain of drug discovery. These include correctly identifying ligand poses near and far from the true binding mode when given a set of reference receptors and classifying ligands as active or inactive using structural information. We use the CNN to re-score or refine poses generated using a conventional scoring function, Autodock Vina, and compare the performance of each of these methods to using the conventional scoring function alone. Furthermore, we assess several ways of choosing appropriate reference receptors in the context of the D3R 2017 community benchmarking challenge. We find that our CNN scoring function outperforms Vina on most tasks without requiring manual inspection by a knowledgeable operator, but that the pose prediction target chosen for the challenge, Cathepsin S, was particularly challenging for de novo docking. However, the CNN provided best-in-class performance on several virtual screening tasks, underscoring the relevance of deep learning to the field of drug discovery.},

Foremost among the models used to elucidate the electrostatic potential is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; however, existing methods for solving this equation have limited the scope of accurate electrostatic calculations to relatively small biomolecular systems. Here we present the application of numerical methods to enable the trivially parallel solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for supramolecular structures that are orders of magnitude larger in size. As a demonstration of this methodology, electrostatic potentials have been calculated for large microtubule and ribosome structures. The results point to the likely role of electrostatics in a variety of activities of these structures.},

Three questions were addressed: how much cell code duplication occurs in notebooks, how does code reuse occur, and what are the preferred sources of code reuse in Jupyter notebooks. They found that one in 13 code cells were duplicates. The four top categories of duplicated code snippets were visualization (21%), machine learning (15%), the definition of functions (12%), and data science (9%). The main method of obtaining code to reuse was by web browsing. The top three kinds of sites visited were tutorial sites (35%), API documentation (32%), and stack overflow (14%). Interestingly, the use of snippet libraries was not mentioned. This suggests that most users of Juptyer notebooks are not taking advantage of the existing nb extensions that support code snippets.},

  abstract  = {Use of subject scores as manifest variables to assess the relationship
between latent variables produces attenuated estimates.
This has been demonstrated for raw scores from
classical test theory (CTT) and factor scores derived from factor
analysis. Conclusions on scores have not been sufficiently
extended to item response theory (IRT) theta estimates, which
are still recommended for estimation of relationships between
latent variables. This is because IRT estimates appear to have
preferable properties compared to CTT, while structural equation
modeling (SEM) is often advised as an alternative to
scores for estimation of the relationship between latent variables.
The present research evaluates the consequences of
using subject scores as manifest variables in regression models
to test the relationship between latent variables. Raw scores
and three methods for obtaining theta estimates were used
and compared to latent variable SEM modeling. A Monte
Carlo study was designed by manipulating sample size, number
of items, type of test, and magnitude of the correlation
between latent variables. Results show that, despite the
advantage of IRT models in other areas, estimates of the relationship
between latent variables are always more accurate
when SEM models are used. Recommendations are offered for
applied researchers.},
  annote    = {In general terms, statistical analysis may be classified into two broad categories: (1) statistical analysis for observed or manifest variables and (2) statistical analysis for unobserved or latent variables. Observed variables are a type of variable that can be measured with a high degree of precision using a single indicator or a simple question in a survey (e.g., country of birth, city of residence, age, weight, height). Latent variables are complex variables that cannot be observed directly through a single indicator or by using subject responses to one simple question (e.g., attitudes, identity, cultural capital). To measure latent variables, researchers often create sets of},

These normalizing constants are notoriously difficult to obtain, as they usually involve highdimensional integrals that cannot be solved analytically. Here we introduce an R package that uses bridge sampling (Meng and Wong 1996; Meng and Schilling 2002) to estimate normalizing constants in a generic and easy-to-use fashion. For models implemented in Stan, the estimation procedure is automatic. We illustrate the functionality of the package with three examples.},

  abstract = {{Biomolecular structure drives function, and computational capabilities have progressed such that the prediction and computational design of biomolecular structures is increasingly feasible. Because computational biophysics attracts students from many different backgrounds and with different levels of resources, teaching the subject can be challenging. One strategy to teach diverse learners is with interactive multimedia material that promotes self-paced, active learning. We have created a hands-on education strategy with a set of 16 modules that teach topics in biomolecular structure and design, from fundamentals of conformational sampling and energy evaluation to applications, such as protein docking, antibody design, and RNA structure prediction. Our modules are based on PyRosetta, a Python library that encapsulates all computational modules and methods in the Rosetta software package. The workshop-style modules are implemented as Jupyter Notebooks that can be executed in the Google Colaboratory, allowing learners access with just a Web browser. The digital format of Jupyter Notebooks allows us to embed images, molecular visualization movies, and interactive coding exercises. This multimodal approach may better reach students from different disciplines and experience levels, as well as attract more researchers from smaller labs and cognate backgrounds to leverage PyRosetta in science and engineering research. All materials are freely available at https://github.com/RosettaCommons/PyRosetta.notebooks.}},

It provides an essential support for presenting results, reasoning on and formulating hypotheses related to molecular structure. Tools for visual exploration of structural data have become easily accessible on a broad variety of platforms thanks to advanced software tools that render a great service to the scientific community. These tools are often developed across disciplines bridging computer science, biology and chemistry. This mini-review was written as a short and compact overview for scientists who need to visualize protein structures and want to make an informed decision which tool they should use. Here, we first describe a few ‘Swiss Army knives’ geared towards protein visualization for everyday use with an existing large user base, then focus on more specialized tools for peculiar needs that are not yet as broadly known. Our selection is by no means exhaustive, but reflects a diverse snapshot of scenarios that we consider informative for the reader. We end with an account of future trends and perspectives.}},

Citation principles encourage authors to provide full descriptions of objects, with stable links, in their papers. As Jupyter notebooks (JNs) aggregate data, software, and other objects, they may facilitate or hinder citation, credit, and access to data and software. We report on a study of references to JNs in astronomy over a five-year period (2014–2018). References increased rapidly, but fewer than half of the references led to JNs that could be located and opened. JNs appear better suited to supporting the research process than to providing access to research objects. We recommend that authors cite individual data and software objects and that they stabilize any notebooks cited in publications. Publishers should increase the number of citations allowed in papers and employ descriptive metadata-rich citation styles that facilitate credit and discovery.},

The notebook elements consist  of human-authored contextual elements and computer code,  and computer-generated output from executing the computer  code. Such outputs can include tables and plots. The  notebook elements can be executed interactively, and the  whole notebook can be saved, re-loaded and re-executed, or  converted to read-only formats such as HTML, LaTeX and PDF.  Exploiting these characteristics, Jupyter notebooks can be  used to improve the effectiveness of computational and data  exploration, documentation, communication, reproducibility  and re-usability of scientific research results. They also  serve as building blocks of remote data access and analysis  as is required for facilities hosting large data sets and  initiatives such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).  In this contribution we report from our experience of using  Jupyter notebooks for data analysis at research facilities,  and outline opportunities and future plans.},

  abstract  = {X-ray crystallography is an invaluable technique for studying the atomic structure of macromolecules. Much of crystallography’s success is due to the software packages developed to enable the automated processing of diffraction data. However, the analysis of unconventional diffraction experiments can still pose significant challenges—many existing programs are closed-source, sparsely documented, or are challenging to integrate with modern libraries for scientific computing and machine learning. Here we describe reciprocalspaceship, a Python library for exploring reciprocal space. It provides a tabular representation for reflection data from diffraction experiments that extends the widely-used pandas library with built-in methods for handling space group, unit cell, and symmetry-based operations. As we illustrate, this library facilitates new modes of exploratory data analysis while supporting the prototyping, development, and release of new methods.},

  abstract     = {The primary data in X-ray diffraction experiments are images which contain bright spots known as reflections. In order to compute the electron density of the crystal which yields these reflections, the intensity of each reflection must be estimated. Redundant observations must be parsimoniously reduced to a set of summary intensities and corresponding error estimates. This task is confounded by a range of systematic effects leading to equivalent reflections being expressed on different scales. Here, we present a modern Bayesian solution to this problem, careless, which uses deep learning and variational inference to simultaneously merge and scale reflection observations. We successfully apply this method to conventional monochromatic X-ray diffraction data, polychromatic diffraction data, and finally X-ray free-electron laser data. Thereby, we find that this single model is generally applicable to many types of X-ray diffraction experiments.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Summary High performance computing (HPC) has led to remarkable advances in science and engineering and has become an indispensable tool for research. Unfortunately, HPC use and adoption by many researchers is often hindered by the complex way these resources are accessed. Indeed, while the web has become the dominant access mechanism for remote computing services in virtually every computing area, HPC is a notable exception. Open OnDemand is an open source project negating this trend by providing web-based access to HPC resources ( https://openondemand.org). This article describes the challenges to adoption and other lessons learned over the 3-year project that may be relevant to other science gateway projects. We end with a description of future plans the project team has during the Open OnDemand 2.0 project including specific developments in machine learning and GPU monitoring.},

In principle, Jupyter notebooks should easily allow to reproduce and extend scientific computations and their findings; but in practice, this is not the case. The individual code cells in Jupyter notebooks can be executed in any order, with identifier usages preceding their definitions and results preceding their computations. In a sample of 936 published notebooks that would be executable in principle, we found that 73% of them would not be reproducible with straightforward approaches, requiring humans to infer (and often guess) the order in which the authors created the cells.In this paper, we present an approach to (1) automatically satisfy dependencies between code cells to reconstruct possible execution orders of the cells; and (2) instrument code cells to mitigate the impact of non-reproducible statements (i.e., random functions) in Jupyter notebooks. Our Osiris prototype takes a notebook as input and outputs the possible execution schemes that reproduce the exact notebook results. In our sample, Osiris was able to reconstruct such schemes for 82.23% of all executable notebooks, which has more than three times better than the state-of-the-art; the resulting reordered code is valid program code and thus available for further testing and analysis.},

He is still active at John Hopkins University, although he is focused on Julia these days.

It might help to have three to ten hours of prior exposure to C and C++. I tried to leap ahead to It has a lengthy appendix that includes a primer setting up your C++ computing environment, a primer on the Doxygen documentation system that I was able to deploy in a few minutes to generate documentation in HTML and LaTeX of a simple program, an overview of C++'s salient points to serve as a refresher after working through the book, and 70 pages of answers to most of the exercises. The latter is rare. The book is now a bit dated because it was published in 2006, and there have been several releases of C++ since then. After reading only the first chapter, I tried to leap ahead to code listing 4.4 around page 54 and could not run it because \mintinline{symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64}. I probably set up the compile command incorrectly. I will have to read chapters two and three.},

  abstract  = {The ATSAS software suite encompasses a number of programs for the processing, visualization, analysis and modelling of small-angle scattering data, with a focus on the data measured from biological macromolecules. Here, new developments in the ATSAS 3.0 package are described. They include IMSIM, for simulating isotropic 2D scattering patterns; IMOP, to perform operations on 2D images and masks; DATRESAMPLE, a method for variance estimation of structural invariants through parametric resampling; DATFT, which computes the pair distance distribution function by a direct Fourier transform of the scattering data; PDDFFIT, to compute the scattering data from a pair distance distribution function, allowing comparison with the experimental data; a new module in DATMW for Bayesian consensus-based concentration-independent molecular weight estimation; DATMIF, an ab initio shape analysis method that optimizes the search model directly against the scattering data; DAMEMB, an application to set up the initial search volume for multiphase modelling of membrane proteins; ELLLIP, to perform quasi-atomistic modelling of liposomes with elliptical shapes; NMATOR, which models conformational changes in nucleic acid structures through normal mode analysis in torsion angle space; DAMMIX, which reconstructs the shape of an unknown intermediate in an evolving system; and LIPMIX and BILMIX, for modelling multilamellar and asymmetric lipid vesicles, respectively. In addition, technical updates were deployed to facilitate maintainability of the package, which include porting the PRIMUS graphical interface to Qt5, updating SASpy – a PyMOL plugin to run a subset of ATSAS tools – to be both Python 2 and 3 compatible, and adding utilities to facilitate mmCIF compatibility in future ATSAS releases. All these features are implemented in ATSAS 3.0, freely available for academic users at https://www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/software.html.},

  abstract  = {Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

This setting includes as a special case all loss-based performance measures, which are simply linear functions of the confusion matrix, but also includes more complex performance measures such as the multiclass G-mean and micro F_1 measures. We give a general framework for designing consistent algorithms for such performance measures by viewing the learning problem as an optimization problem over the set of feasible confusion matrices, and give two specific instantiations based on the Frank-Wolfe method for concave performance measures and on the bisection method for ratio-of-linear performance measures. The resulting algorithms are provably consistent and outperform a multiclass version of the state-of-the-art SVMperf method in experiments; for large multiclass problems, the algorithms are also orders of magnitude faster than SVMperf.},

what are often presumed to be small but possibly important differences in size, lattice distortions, and
defects, which can only be understood by structural characterization with high spatial 3D resolution. We solved
the structures of individual colloidal platinum nanocrystals by developing atomic-resolution 3D liquid-cell
electron microscopy to reveal critical intrinsic heterogeneity of ligand-protected platinum nanocrystals in
solution, including structural degeneracies, lattice parameter deviations, internal defects, and strain. These
differences in structure lead to substantial contributions to free energies, consequential enough that they must
be considered in any discussion of fundamental nanocrystal properties or applications.},

  abstract = {The 2′-deoxynucleoside 5′-phosphate N-hydrolase 1 (DNPH1) has been proposed as a new molecular target for cancer treatment. Here, we describe the synthesis of a series of novel 6-aryl- and 6-heteroarylpurine riboside 5′-monophosphates via Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, and their ability to inhibit recombinant rat and human DNPH1. Enzymatic inhibition studies revealed competitive inhibitors in the low micromolar range. Crystal structures of human and rat DNPH1 in complex with one nucleotide from this series, the 6-naphthylpurine derivative, provided detailed structural information, in particular regarding the possible conformations of a long and flexible loop wrapping around the large hydrophobic substituent. Taking advantage of these high-resolution structures, we performed virtual docking studies in order to evaluate enzyme–inhibitor interactions for the whole compound series. Among the synthesized compounds, several molecules exhibited significant in vitro cytotoxicity against human colon cancer (HCT15, HCT116) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) cell lines with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, which correlated with in vitro DNPH1 inhibitory potency.},

Designed base pair interactions allow complex nano-objects to self-assemble from simple RNA motifs. X-ray crystallography plays an important role in both the design and analysis of such RNA nanostructures. Here, we describe methods for the design and X-ray crystallographic structure analysis of an RNA square and two different triangles, which self-assemble from short oligonucleotides and serve as a platform for building functional nano-sized nucleic acid architectures.},

  abstract = {{Unlike DNA, in addition to the 2′-OH group, uracil nucleobase and its modifications play essential roles in structure and function diversities of non-coding RNAs. Non-canonical U•U base pair is ubiquitous in non-coding RNAs, which are highly diversified. However, it is not completely clear how uracil plays the diversifing roles. To investigate and compare the uracil in U-A and U•U base pairs, we have decided to probe them with a selenium atom by synthesizing the novel 4-Se-uridine (SeU) phosphoramidite and Se-nucleobase-modified RNAs (SeU-RNAs), where the exo-4-oxygen of uracil is replaced by selenium. Our crystal structure studies of U-A and U$\cdot$U pairs reveal that the native and Se-derivatized structures are virtually identical, and both U-A and U\cdot$U pairs can accommodate large Se atoms. Our thermostability and crystal structure studies indicate that the weakened H-bonding in U-A pair may be compensated by the base stacking, and that the stacking of the trans-Hoogsteen U\cdot$U pairs may stabilize RNA duplex and its junction. Our result confirms that the hydrogen bond (O4…H-C5) of the Hoogsteen pair is weak. Using the Se atom probe, our Se-functionalization studies reveal more insights into the U•U interaction and U-participation in structure and function diversification of nucleic acids.}},

  abstract  = {Using a web browser without additional software and generating interactive high quality and high resolution images of bio-molecules is no longer a problem. Interactive visualization of 3D molecule structures by Internet browsers normally is not possible without additional software and the disadvantage of browser-based structure images (e.g. by a Java applet) is their low resolution. Scientists who want to generate 3D molecular images with high quality and high resolution (e.g. for publications or to render a molecule for a poster) therefore require separately installed software that is often not easy to use. The alternative concept is an interactive server-side rendering application that can be interfaced with any web browser. Thus it combines the advantage of the web application with the high-end rendering of a raytracer. This article addresses users who want to generate high quality images from molecular structures and do not have software installed locally for structure visualization. Often people do not have a structure viewer, such as RasMol or Chime (or even Java) installed locally but want to visualize a molecule structure interactively. AISMIG (An Interactive Server-side Molecule Image Generator) is a web service that provides a visualization of molecule structures in such cases.

  abstract  = {Enhancing sampling and analyzing simulations are central issues in molecular simulation. Recently, we introduced PLUMED, an open-source plug-in that provides some of the most popular molecular dynamics (MD) codes with implementations of a variety of different enhanced sampling algorithms and collective variables (CVs). The rapid changes in this field, in particular new directions in enhanced sampling and dimensionality reduction together with new hardware, require a code that is more flexible and more efficient. We therefore present PLUMED 2 here—a complete rewrite of the code in an object-oriented programming language (C++). This new version introduces greater flexibility and greater modularity, which both extends its core capabilities and makes it far easier to add new methods and CVs. It also has a simpler interface with the MD engines and provides a single software library containing both tools and core facilities. Ultimately, the new code better serves the ever-growing community of users and contributors in coping with the new challenges arising in the field.
Program summary
Program title: PLUMED 2 Catalogue identifier: AEEE_v2_0 Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEEE_v2_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen’s University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Yes No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 700646 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 6618136 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: ANSI-C++. Computer: Any computer capable of running an executable produced by a C++ compiler. Operating system: Linux operating system, Unix OSs. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes, parallelized using MPI. RAM: Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. Classification: 3, 7.7, 23. Catalogue identifier of previous version: AEEE_v1_0. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 180 (2009) 1961. External routines: GNU libmatheval, Lapack, Blas, MPI. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: This version supersedes the previous version for the most part. There are a small number of very specific situations where the previous version is better, due to performance or to non-ported features. We are actively working on porting these last few features into the new code. Nature of problem: Calculation of free-energy surfaces for molecular systems of interest in biology, chemistry and materials science, on the fly and a posteriori analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories using advanced collective variables. Solution method: Implementations of various collective variables and enhanced sampling techniques. Reasons for new version: The old version was difficult to maintain and its design was not as flexible as this new version. This lack of flexibility made it difficult to implement a number of novel methods that have emerged since the release of the original code. Summary of revisions: The new version of the code has a completely redesigned architecture, which allows for several important enhancements. This allows for a much simpler and robust input syntax and for improved performance. In addition, it provides several, more-complex collective variables which could not have been written using the previous implementation. Furthermore, the entire code is fully documented so it is easier to extend. Finally, the code is designed so that users can implement new variables directly in the input files and thus develop bespoke applications of these powerful algorithms. Unusual features: PLUMED 2 can be used either as a standalone program, e.g. for a posteriori analysis of trajectories, or as a library embedded in a molecular dynamics code (such as GROMACS, NAMD, Quantum ESPRESSO, and LAMMPS). Interfaces with these particular codes are provided in patches, which a simple script will insert into the underlying molecular dynamics codes source code files. For other molecular dynamics codes there is extensive documentation on how to add PLUMED in our manual. Additional comments: The distribution file contains a test suite, user and developer documentation and a collection of patches and utilities. Running time: Depends on the number of atoms, the method chosen and the collective variables used. The regression test suite provided takes approximately 1 min to run.},

Starting from the amino acid sequence of a target protein, users can take advantage of PyMod 3 to carry out all the steps of the homology modeling process (i.e. template searching, target–template sequence alignment, model building and quality assessment). Additionally, the integrated tools in PyMod 3 may also be used alone, in order to extend PyMOL with a wide range of capabilities. Sequence similarity searches, multiple sequence/structure alignment building, phylogenetic trees and evolutionary conservation analyses, domain parsing, single/multiple chains and loop modeling can be performed in the PyMod 3/PyMOL environment.

This has motivated widespread efforts to predict enzyme function computationally. The most useful/accurate strategies employed to date are based on the detection of motifs in novel structures that correspond to a specific function. Functional residues are critical components of predictively useful motifs. We have implemented a novel method, to complement current approaches, which detects motifs solely on the basis of distance restraints between catalytic residues. ProMOL is a plugin for the PyMOL molecular graphics environment that can be used to create active site motifs for enzymes. A library of 181 active site motifs has been created with ProMOL, based on definitions published in the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA). Searches with ProMOL produce better than 50% useful Enzyme Commission (EC) class suggestions for level 1 searches in EC classes 1, 4 and 5, and produce some useful results for other classes. 261 additional motifs automatically translated from Jonathan Barker’s JESS motif set [Bioinformatics 19:1644–1649, 2003] and a set of NMR motifs is under development. Alignments are evaluated by visual superposition, Levenshtein distance and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and are reasonably consistent with related search methods. The ProMOL plugin for PyMOL provides ready access to template-based local alignments. Recent improvements to ProMOL, including the expanded motif library, RMSD calculations and output selection formatting, have greatly increased the program’s usability and speed, and have improved the way that the results are presented.},

  abstract  = {Despite the well-known adverse health effects associated with tobacco use, addiction to nicotine found in tobacco products causes difficulty in quitting among users. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are the physiological targets of nicotine and facilitate addiction to tobacco products. The nAChR α7 receptor subtype plays an important role in addiction; therefore, predicting the binding activity of tobacco constituents to nAChR α7 would contribute to methods assessing the addictive potential of tobacco constituents. Among the receptor-ligand complexes obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), we found that there were two distinct clusters of binding-pocket conformations for nAChR α7. One template was selected from each cluster to construct the 3D structures of human nAChR α7 using homology modeling. The competitive docking model was developed for determination of the structure of nAChR α7 bound with a chemical. To develop a prediction model of human α7 binding activity, we used a training data set of extracted 930 chemicals assessed for human α7 binding from the two databases, PubChem and ChEMBL. We also extracted 1448 chemicals evaluated for rat α7 binding from the same databases as the external testing data set. Based on the competitive docking results, the winning docking scores were partitioned to identify the key residues that play important roles in the receptor-ligand binding for each chemical. Our previously published algorithm, Decision Forest (DF), which combines multiple Decision Tree models was used to train the human α7 binding activity prediction model based on the partitioned docking scores. Five-fold cross validations were conducted to estimate the performance of the DF models. The DF model was tested using the external testing data set and then was used to predict the potential human α7 binding activity for the 5275 tobacco constituents of unknown activity. The human α7 binding activity data for 84 of the 5275 tobacco constituents were experimentally measured to confirm the prediction results. The overall prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 77.4%, 57.7% and 86.2%, respectively, demonstrating that the developed predictive model of human α7 binding activity could be a useful tool for high-throughput screening of potential addictive tobacco constituents.

huge success. However, it is inevitable that more high-profile biological drug
targets will be identified for which high-quality, highly homogenous crystal
systems cannot be found. With increasing heterogeneity in crystal systems, the
application of current multi-data-set methods becomes ever less sensitive to
bound ligands. In order to ease the bottleneck of finding a well behaved crystal
system, pre-clustering of data sets can be carried out using cluster4x after data
collection to separate data sets into smaller partitions in order to restore the
sensitivity of multi-data-set methods. Here, the software cluster4x is introduced
for this purpose and validated against published data sets using PanDDA,
showing an improved total signal from existing ligands and identifying new hits
in both highly heterogenous and less heterogenous multi-data sets. cluster4x

Key Features: Using ML methods by itself doesn't ensure building classifiers that generalize well for new data Identifying optimal feature subsets and hyper-parameters of ML methods can be resolved using design and analysis of statistical experiments Using a bootstrapping approach to massive sampling of training and tests datasets with various data characteristics (e.g.: contaminated training sets) allows dealing with bias Developing of SAS-based table-driven environment allows managing all meta-data related to the proposed AI framework and creating interoperability with R libraries to accomplish variety of statistical and machine-learning tasks Computer programs in R and SAS that create AI framework are available on GitHub},

proteins is an important process to study their molecular structures. The quality of crystals is critical to be able to determine
their structures using methods such as X-ray crystallography.
Therefore, many wet-lab experiments are conducted using numerous screening plates to obtain successful crystal growth. Highthroughput microscopy is useful to quickly collect images from
the screening plates. Since the automated systems for imaging
require high-end instrumentation, they are costly. This study
investigates a small scale, mobile fluorescence imaging system,
and application. Our system is composed of a mobile imaging
system, a mobile app to capture images from plates, and a
machine learning model to recognize the presence of crystals
presence from images. For fluorescence imaging, we present an
assembly of a smartphone or tablet integrated with a macro
lens tube and illumination LEDs. The system presented in this
study has magnification range from 20x to 250x macro. For the
recognition of crystals, a convolutional neural network model
was trained on a computer and then deployed on the mobile
app. A data set of 1000 trace fluorescently labeled images was
used to train and evaluate the model. The accuracy of the
hold-out testing images was about 95%. The mobile app for
imaging and protein recognition was developed to run on Apple
iOS devices. To evaluate the system further, the recombinant
inorganic pyrophosphatase protein from Klebsiella pneumoniae,
which was expressed from E. coli, was crystallized using the
trace fluorescent labeling method. Our system can capture
quality images of protein crystals in both white and fluorescence
lights. The overall accuracy of recognizing crystal or non-crystal
outcomes on the pilot test is about 93\%. This mobile imaging
system can be useful for small group research labs and students},

An unusual variant of the cobalamin riboswitch with predicted structural features was identified in Bacillus subtilis over a decade ago, but its structure and mechanisms of cobalamin selectivity and translational control have remained unsolved. We present the crystal structure of the aptamer domain of this atypical cobalamin riboswitch and a model for the complete riboswitch, including its expression platform domain. We demonstrate that this riboswitch binds to multiple cobalamin derivatives and correlate its promiscuous behavior to its structure and unique arrangement of peripheral elements. Comparative structural analyses between conventional cobalamin riboswitches and the B. subtilis cobalamin riboswitch reveal that the likely basis for this promiscuous ligand binding is intrinsic structural adaptability encoded in the RNA structure. It suggests that cobalamin selectivity might ultimately be viewed as existing on a spectrum of affinity for each derivative rather than as belonging to distinct types based on ligand specificities. Our work provides an interesting and notable example of functional coupling of ligand-sensing and adaptive folding by a structured RNA molecule.}},

  abstract  = {Two commensurately modulated structures (PDB entries 4n3e and 6sjj) were solved using translational noncrystallographic symmetry (tNCS). The data required the use of large supercells, sevenfold and ninefold, respectively, to properly index the reflections. Commensurately modulated structures can be challenging to solve. Molecular-replacement software such as Phaser can detect tNCS and either handle it automatically or, for more challenging situations, allow the user to enter a tNCS vector, which the software then uses to place the components. Although this approach has been successful in solving these types of challenging structures, it does not make it easy to understand the underlying modulation in the structure or how these two structures are related. An alternate view of this problem is that the atoms and associated parameters are following periodic atomic modulation functions (AMFs) in higher dimensional space, and what is being observed in these supercells are the points where these higher dimensional AMFs intersect physical 3D space. In this case, the two 3D structures, with a sevenfold and a ninefold superstructure, seem to be quite different. However, describing those structures within the higher dimensional superspace approach makes a strong case that they are closely related, as they show very similar AMFs and can be described with one unique (3+1)D structure, i.e. they are two different 3D intersections of the same (3+1)D structure.},

  abstract  = {Protein crystallization screening helps determine factors (e.g., salts, pH of buffers, ionic strengths, temperature, and type of precipitants) that are favorable for the formation of a large protein crystal suitable for X-ray crystallography. While existing commercial screens may not generate crystalline outcomes for difficult proteins, their outcomes could be used for recommending novel screens. Current methods for protein crystallization screening such as associative experimental design (AED) process only cocktails having one chemical per reagent while ignoring cocktails with multiple chemicals per reagent. To analyze cocktails having multiple chemicals per reagent, we propose enhanced associative experimental design (AED) that recommends novel crystallization conditions by analyzing the content of successful preliminary crystallization conditions. In wet lab experiments, our enhanced AED (AED+) yielded ten new crystalline conditions for Tt189 (Nucleoside diphosphate kinase) in addition to 20 crystalline conditions generated by AED. Moreover, our AED+ allows pairing of crystalline or likely lead outcome with a non-crystalline outcome to generate novel crystalline conditions overcoming the limitation of AED requiring at least two good cocktails having at least one coming reagent.},

  abstract  = {Biological macromolecules have evolved to fold and operate in the crowded environment of the cell. We have shown previously that molecular crowding stabilizes folded RNA structures. Here we report SAXS measurements on a 64 kDa bacterial group I ribozyme in the presence of mono- and divalent ions and PEG crowders of different molecular weight. These experiments show that crowders always stabilize the folded RNA, but this stabilization is weaker in NaCl solutions than MgCl2 solutions. Additionally, we find that RNAs with the same global structure, parametrized by Rg, have different scattering functions depending upon the ratio of electrostatic and entropic stabilization by ions and crowders, respectively. We quantify this difference using the scattering length per scattering volume and find that this ratio is larger for RNAs that fold in lower ionic strength solutions due to the higher crowder content. We conclude that lower RNA flexibility, or reduced configurational entropy, widens the free energy gap between the unfolded and folded RNA in crowded MgCl2 solutions.},

  abstract  = {Currently, the great majority of the data that are used for solving macromolecular structures by X-ray crystallography are collected at cryogenic temperatures. Selection of a suitable cryoprotectant, which ensures crystal stability at low temperatures, is critical for the success of a particular diffraction experiment. The effectiveness of salts of organic acids as potential cryoprotective agents is presented in the following work. Sodium formate, acetate, malonate and citrate were tested, as were sodium potassium tartrate and acetate in the form of potassium and ammonium salts. For each salt investigated, the minimal concentration that was required for successful cryo­protection was determined over the pH range 4.5-9.5. The cryoprotective ability of these organic salts depends upon the number of carboxylic groups; the lowest concentration required for cryoprotection was observed at neutral pH. Case-study experiments conducted using the tetragonal form of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEWL) con­firmed that salts of organic acids can successfully act as cryoprotective agents of protein crystals grown from high concentrations of inorganic salts. When crystals are grown from solutions containing a sufficient concentration of organic acid salts no additional cryoprotection is needed as the crystals can safely be frozen directly from the crystallizing buffers.},

  abstract  = {Landscapes exhibiting multiple secondary structures arise in natural RNA molecules that
modulate gene expression, protein synthesis, and viral. We report herein that high-throughput chemical experiments can isolate an RNA’s multiple alternative secondary structures as
they are stabilized by systematic mutagenesis (mutate-and-map, M2
) and that a computational algorithm, REEFFIT, enables unbiased reconstruction of these states’ structures and
populations. In an in silico benchmark on non-coding RNAs with complex landscapes, M2
-
REEFFIT recovers 95% of RNA helices present with at least 25% population while maintaining a low false discovery rate (10%) and conservative error estimates. In experimental
benchmarks, M2
-REEFFIT recovers the structure landscapes of a 35-nt MedLoop hairpin, a
110-nt 16S rRNA four-way junction with an excited state, a 25-nt bistable hairpin, and a
112-nt three-state adenine riboswitch with its expression platform, molecules whose characterization previously required expert mutational analysis and specialized NMR or chemical mapping experiments. With this validation, M2
-REEFFIT enabled tests of whether
artificial RNA sequences might exhibit complex landscapes in the absence of explicit
design. An artificial flavin mononucleotide riboswitch and a randomly generated RNA
sequence are found to interconvert between three or more states, including structures for
which there was no design, but that could be stabilized through mutations. These results
highlight the likely pervasiveness of rich landscapes with multiple secondary structures in
both natural and artificial RNAs and demonstrate an automated chemical/computational
route for their empirical characterization.},

  abstract           = {alpha6* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are highly and selectively expressed by mesostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons. These neurons are thought to mediate several behavioral effects of nicotine, including locomotion, habit learning, and reinforcement. Yet the functional role of alpha6* nAChRs in midbrain DA neurons is mostly unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the composition and in vivo functional role of alpha6* nAChR in mesolimbic DA neurons of male rats. Immunoprecipitation and immunopurification techniques coupled with cell-specific lesions showed that the composition of alpha6* nAChR in the mesostriatal system is heterogeneous, with (non-alpha4)alpha6beta2* being predominant in the mesolimbic pathway and alpha4alpha6beta2* in the nigrostriatal pathway. We verified whether alpha6* receptors mediate the systemic effects of nicotine on the mesolimbic DA pathway by perfusing the selective antagonists alpha-conotoxin MII (CntxMII) (alpha3/alpha6beta2* selective) or alpha-conotoxin PIA (CntxPIA) (alpha6beta2* selective) into ventral tegmental area (VTA). The intra-VTA perfusion of CntxMII or CntxPIA markedly decreased systemic nicotine-elicited DA release in the nucleus accumbens and habituated locomotion; the intra-VTA perfusion of CntxMII also decreased the rate of nicotine infusion in the maintenance phase of nicotine, but not of food, self-administration. Overall, the results of these experiments show that the alpha6beta2* nAChRs expressed in the VTA are necessary for the effects of systemic nicotine on DA neuron activity and DA-dependent behaviors such as locomotion and reinforcement, and suggest that alpha6beta2*-selective compounds capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier may affect the addictive properties of nicotine and therefore be useful in the treatment of tobacco dependence.},

  abstract  = {Expansions of short nucleotide repeats produce several neurological and neuromuscular disorders including Huntington
disease, muscular dystrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A common pathological feature of these diseases is the
accumulation of the repeat-containing transcripts into aberrant foci in the nucleus. RNA foci, as well as the disease
symptoms, only manifest above a critical number of nucleotide repeats, but the molecular mechanism governing foci
formation above this characteristic threshold remains unresolved. Here we show that repeat expansions create templates
for multivalent base-pairing, which causes purified RNA to undergo a sol–gel transition in vitro at a similar critical repeat
number as observed in the diseases. In human cells, RNA foci form by phase separation of the repeat-containing RNA
and can be dissolved by agents that disrupt RNA gelation in vitro. Analogous to protein aggregation disorders, our results
suggest that the sequence-specific gelation of RNAs could be a contributing factor to neurological disease.},

  annote    = {Emacs is a powerful text editor, if not the most powerful text editor available that has packages that extend its features beyond text editing. Some Emacs afficinados spend all day in Emacs. It strongly supports the organizing projects and time management. You can start using it via the options in the pull-down menus and without knowing any keybindings. The official GNu Emacs documentation is a bit inaccessible for the beginner, so this well-written book are very welcome. It was written by a team of five authors. The first edition was released in 1991, so the authors had over a decade to improve the book. The book was meant to be very accessible. Nonetheless, I suspect that some prior experience with Emacs will be a helpful. If you are a beginner, you really have to internalize the content of chapters 1 and 2 as recommended by the authors. If you struggle with the first two chapters, read the book by Hahn. *Learning GNU Emacs* will definitely move advanced beginngers to the competent user level, in spite of lacking coverage of some of the currently popular packages. The book is 509 pages, so it is a bit a pain to lug around. Nonetheless, the content is too verbose or deep. Although it is almost two decades old, more the 95\% of the commands still work. It was written before git and org became widely used, so only the version control and outline-mode chapters are dated. This says a lot about the stability of Emacs that so much of the book's content is still so relevant. I do look forward to a fourth edition with coverage of some of more recent and popular packages such as helm and ivy for autocompletion. Nonetheless, after mastering the content of this book, you will understand most of the features of Emacs, and you will be well-prepared to master those newer packages and more advanced topics. I recommend it as a second book because only chapters 1 and 2 overlap with Hahn.},

It began as a computer science experiment in the early 1970s, spread to universities around the world in the late 70s, became the darling of the computer industry in the 1980s, and (in its incarnation as GNU/Linux) helped launch the explosive growth of the Internet in the 1990s. More than simply being a story of the spread of a technology, UNIX has enabled the creation, growth and renement of a mode of coding|designing, composing, writing and documenting of software|that has become a kind of lingua franca for geeks, hackers, scientists, engineers, and hobbyists alike. This paper explores two historical cases of software authorship related to UNIX which have implications for the meaning and practice of modern software coding: the case of the EMACS editor and the GNU General Public License and the case of the programming tool known as grep, which searches text using \regular expressions." Both cases oer insight into the nature of contemporary invention and authorship on the realm of software programming.},

considered two separate tasks, leading to several problems:
the documentation may never be written; when it is, it may
be an afterthought; and when the program is modi ed, the
needed changes to the documentation may be overlooked.
Literate programming (LP), introduced by Donald Knuth,
views a program and its documentation as an integrated
whole: they are written together to inform both the com-
puter and human readers. LP tools then extract the code
for the computer and the documentation for further docu-
ment processing. Unfortunately, existing LP tools are much
more suited for compiled languages, where there is already a
step between coding and executing and debugging the code.
Lisp programming typically involves incremental develop-
ment and testing, often highly interleaving coding with run-
ning portions of the code. Thus LP tools inject an arti cial
impediment into this process.
LP/Lisp is a new LP tool designed speci cally for Lisp and
the usual style of programming using Lisp. The literate pro-
gramming  le is the Lisp  le; LP markup and text resides in
Lisp comments, where it does not interfere with running the
code. LP/Lisp provides the usual literate programming ser-
vices, such as code typesetting, syntactic sugaring, and the
ability to split the code for expository purposes (a \chunk"
mechanism). LP/Lisp, itself written in Lisp, is run on the
code to produce the documentation.},

Typed Clojure enables Clojure programmers to gain greater confidence in the correctness of their code via static type checking while remaining in the Clojure world, and has acquired significant adoption in the Clojure community. Typed Clojure repurposes Typed Racket's occurrence typing, an approach to statically reasoning about predicate tests, and also includes several new type system features to handle existing Clojure idioms.},

  abstract  = {Well-ordered crystals of a genomic hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, a large, globular RNA, were obtained employing a new crystallization method. A high-affinity binding site for the spliceosomal protein U1A was engineered into a segment of the catalytic RNA that is dispensable for catalysis. Because molecular surfaces of proteins are more chemically varied than those of RNA, the presence of the protein moiety was expected to facilitate crystallization and improve crystal order. The HDV ribozyme-U1A complex crystallized readily, and its structure was solved using standard techniques for heavy-atom derivatization of protein crystals. Over 1200 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface area of the complex are involved in crystal contacts. As protein-protein interactions comprise 85 % of this buried area, these crystals appear to be held together predominantly by the protein component of the complex. Our crystallization method should be useful for the structure determination of other biochemically important RNAs for which protein partners do not exist or are experimentally intractable. The refined model of the complex (R-free = 27.9 % for all reflections between 20.0 and 2.3 Å) reveals an RNA with a deep active site cleft. Well-ordered metal ions are not observed crystallographically in this cavity. Biochemical results of previous workers had suggested an important role in catalysis for cytosine 75. The pyrimidine base of this residue is buried at the bottom of the active site in an environment that could raise its pKa value. We propose that this highly conserved cytosine may be the general base that catalyzes the transesterification.},

  annote    = {NGLview is a Python package that uses Python on the server and Javascript on the client. The ipywidgets package integrates Nglview with Jupyter. The NGLViewer uses WebGL accelerated molecular graphics so it embedded on the client-side. Interactive computing allows an exploratory process where each computation yields results that guide the next step. Jupyter Notebooks have been adopted by some research communities to analyze and share data. Code and data are put into context by in-line output and flanking explanatory prose. In contrast, standalone molecular graphics packages integrate visualization and computations via plugins. Jupyter notebooks enable a modular approach with greater intermingling of multiple software packages and libraries. Other tools that integrate molecular graphics in Jupyter notebooks include 3dmol.js (Rego and Koes, 2015), chemview (https://github.com/gabrielelanaro/chemview) and pv (https://github.com/biasmv/pv). Large trajectories are sent to Jupyter frame by frame. Although NGLView can read in a number of structure and trajectory data types, custom adaptors can be built for any structure or trajectory data type. The user just needs to write a class that implements the Structure or Trajectory interface from the base\_adaptor. Objects of such classes can be passed to the NGLWidget contructor to create a view for that data, so you have to know the basics of object oriented programming to make such customizations. The documentation is found here (http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/api.html).},

  abstract       = {For the successful X-ray structure determination of macromolecules, it is first necessary to identify, usually by matrix screening, conditions that yield some sort of crystals. Initial crystals are frequently microcrystals or clusters, and often have unfavorable morphologies or yield poor diffraction intensities. It is therefore generally necessary to improve upon these initial conditions in order to obtain better crystals of sufficient quality for X-ray data collection. Even when the initial samples are suitable, often marginally, refinement of conditions is recommended in order to obtain the highest quality crystals that can be grown. The quality of an X-ray structure determination is directly correlated with the size and the perfection of the crystalline samples; thus, refinement of conditions should always be a primary component of crystal growth. The improvement process is referred to as optimization, and it entails sequential, incremental changes in the chemical parameters that influence crystallization, such as pH, ionic strength and precipitant concentration, as well as physical parameters such as temperature, sample volume and overall methodology. It also includes the application of some unique procedures and approaches, and the addition of novel components such as detergents, ligands or other small molecules that may enhance nucleation or crystal development. Here, an attempt is made to provide guidance on how optimization might best be applied to crystal-growth problems, and what parameters and factors might most profitably be explored to accelerate and achieve success.},

or brought to a halt by crystal imperfections. These issues motivated
us to write up what we affectionately call ‘The Definitive Hitchhiker’s
Guide to Pathological Macromolecular Crystals: Lattice Disorders and
Modulations’. Perhaps the most challenging imperfections are lattice
order–disorder phenomena and positional modulations. Many
of these types of crystals have been solved, and progress has been
made on the more challenging forms. Diagnostic tools and how to
solve many of these problem crystal structures are reviewed. New
avenues are provided for approaching the solution of incommensurately
modulated crystals. There are a good number of case studies
in the literature of lattice order–disorder phenomena and crystallographic
modulations that make it timely to write a review. This review
concludes with a projected pathway for solving incommensurately
modulated crystals, personal views of future directions and needs of
the crystallographic community.},

  abstract  = {Building Your Next Big Thing with Google Cloud Platform shows you how to take advantage of the Google Cloud Platform technologies to build all kinds of cloud-hosted software and services for both public and private consumption. Whether you need a simple virtual server to run your legacy application or you need to architect a sophisticated high-traffic web application, Cloud Platform provides all the tools and products required to create innovative applications and a robust infrastructure to manage them.

Google is known for the scalability, reliability, and efficiency of its various online products, from Google Search to Gmail. And, the results are impressive. Google Search, for example, returns results literally within fractions of second. How is this possible? Google custom-builds both hardware and software, including servers, switches, networks, data centers, the operating system’s stack, application frameworks, applications, and APIs.

Have you ever imagined what you could build if you were able to tap the same infrastructure that Google uses to create and manage its products?

Now you can! Building Your Next Big Thing with Google Cloud Platform shows you how to take advantage of the Google Cloud Platform technologies to build all kinds of cloud-hosted software and services for both public and private consumption. Whether you need a simple virtual server to run your legacy application or you need to architect a sophisticated high-traffic web application, Cloud Platform provides all the tools and products required to create innovative applications and a robust infrastructure to manage them.

Using this book as your compass, you can navigate your way through the Google Cloud Platform and turn your ideas into reality. The authors, both Google Developer Experts in Google Cloud Platform, systematically introduce various Cloud Platform products one at a time and discuss their strengths and scenarios where they are a suitable fit. But rather than a manual-like "tell all" approach, the emphasis is on how to Get Things Done so that you get up to speed with Google Cloud Platform as quickly as possible. You will learn how to use the following technologies, among others:

Google Compute Engine
Google App Engine
Google Container Engine
Google App Engine Managed VMs
Google Cloud SQL
Google Cloud Storage
Google Cloud Datastore
Google BigQuery
Google Cloud Dataflow
Google Cloud DNS
Google Cloud Pub/Sub
Google Cloud Endpoints
Google Cloud Deployment Manager
Author on Google Cloud Platform
Google APIs and Translate API

Using real-world examples, the authors first walk you through the basics of cloud computing, cloud terminologies and public cloud services. Then they dive right into Google Cloud Platform and how you can use it to tackle your challenges, build new products, analyze big data, and much more. Whether you’re an independent developer, startup, or Fortune 500 company, you have never had easier to access to world-class production, product development, and infrastructure tools. Google Cloud Platform is your ticket to leveraging your skills and knowledge into making reliable, scalable, and efficient products—just like how Google builds its own products.},
