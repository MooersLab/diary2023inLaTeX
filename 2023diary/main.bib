  abstract  = {An efficient optimization method for the crystallization of biological macromolecules has been developed and tested. This builds on a successful high-throughput technique for the determination of initial crystallization conditions. The optimization method takes an initial condition identified through screening and then varies the concentration of the macromolecule, precipitant, and the growth temperature in a systematic manner. The amount of sample and number of steps is minimized and no biochemical reformulation is required. In the current application a robotic liquid handling system enables high-throughput use, but the technique can easily be adapted in a nonautomated setting. This method has been applied successfully for the rapid optimization of crystallization conditions in nine representative cases.},

  abstract       = {Interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) are innate immune effector molecules that are thought to confer antiviral defence through disruption of protein-protein interactions in the host translation-initiation machinery. However, it was recently discovered that IFITs can directly recognize viral RNA bearing a 5'-triphosphate group (PPP-RNA), which is a molecular signature that distinguishes it from host RNA. Here we report crystal structures of human IFIT5, its complex with PPP-RNAs, and an amino-terminal fragment of IFIT1. The structures reveal a new helical domain that houses a positively charged cavity designed to specifically engage only single-stranded PPP-RNA, thus distinguishing it from the canonical cytosolic sensor of double-stranded viral PPP-RNA, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, also known as DDX58). Mutational analysis, proteolysis and gel-shift assays reveal that PPP-RNA is bound in a non-sequence-specific manner and requires a 5'-overhang of approximately three nucleotides. Abrogation of PPP-RNA binding in IFIT1 and IFIT5 was found to cause a defect in the antiviral response by human embryonic kidney cells. These results demonstrate the mechanism by which IFIT proteins selectively recognize viral RNA, and lend insight into their downstream effector function.},

   Abstract = {In the current study we aimed at developing a vaccine delivery/adjuvant system to enhance anti-tumor immunity against the natural multi-epitope HER2/Neu-derived P5 peptide. Polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] is a strong immunoadjuvant able to enhance specific antitumor immunity induced by peptide-based vaccines. Nevertheless, delivering the peptide and adjuvant intracellularly into their target site remains a challenging issue. We hypothesized this barrier could be overcome through the use of a cationic nanoliposome carrier system which can carry and protect the antigen and adjuvant in the extracellular environment and augment the induction of antitumor immunity. P5 was encapsulated in cationic nanoliposomes composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP)-Cholesterol either alone or complexed with Poly (I:C). Immunocompetent BALB/c mice were immunized with the formulations 3 times in two-week intervals and the efficiency and type of immune response were then evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. The groups immunized with Lip-P5+PIC (DOTAP-Cholestrol-P5+Poly (I:C)) and Lip+PIC (DOTAP-Cholestrol+Poly (I:C)) enhanced the release of Interferon (IFN)-âÃ©Â¬â¥ in comparison with other groups. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Lip-P5+PIC formulation induced the highest level of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ in CD8(+) lymphocytes. Lip-P5+PIC, Lip+PIC and Lip-P5 (DOTAP-Cholestrol-P5) provided some extent of protection in terms of tumor regression in TUBO tumor mice model during the first 65days post tumor challenge but at the end only the tumors of mice immunized with Lip-P5+PIC were significantly smaller than all other groups. Furthermore, tumors of mice receiving Lip-P5+PIC grew at a significantly slower rate throughout the observation period. Our results showed that the combination of Poly (I:C) and DOTAP with the tumor antigen and without applying additional T-helper epitope induced strong antitumor responses. The observations presented here are of great interest for future vaccine studies.},

   Abstract = {Synthetic genetics is a subdiscipline of synthetic biology that aims to develop artificial genetic polymers (also referred to as xeno-nucleic acids or XNAs) that can replicate in vitro and eventually in model cellular organisms. This field of science combines organic chemistry with polymerase engineering to create alternative forms of DNA that can store genetic information and evolve in response to external stimuli. Practitioners of synthetic genetics postulate that XNA could be used to safeguard synthetic biology organisms by storing genetic information in orthogonal chromosomes. XNA polymers are also under active investigation as a source of nuclease resistant affinity reagents (aptamers) and catalysts (xenozymes) with practical applications in disease diagnosis and treatment. In this review, we provide a structural perspective on known antiparallel duplex structures in which at least one strand of the Watson-Crick duplex is composed entirely of XNA. Currently, only a handful of XNA structures have been archived in the Protein Data Bank as compared to the more than 100 000 structures that are now available. Given the growing interest in xenobiology projects, we chose to compare the structural features of XNA polymers and discuss their potential to access new regions of nucleic acid fold space.},

   Abstract = {The development of a preventive vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection is the most efficient method to control the epidemic. The ultimate goal is to develop a vaccine able to induce specific neutralizing, non-neutralizing antibodies and cellular mediated immunity (CMI). Humoral and CMI responses can be directed to glycoproteins that are normally presented as a trimeric spike on the virus surface (gp140). Despite safer, subunit vaccines are normally less immunogenic/effective and need to be delivered together with an adjuvant. The choice of a suitable adjuvant can induce effective humoral and CMI that utterly lead to full protection against disease. In this report, we established a hierarchy of adjuvant potency on humoral and CMI when admixed with the recombinant HIV gp140 trimer. We show that vaccination with gp140 in the presence of different adjuvants can induce high-affinity antibodies, follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells. The data show that poly (I:C) is the most potent adjuvant to induce specific CMI responses evidenced by IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ production and CD4+/CD8+ T cell proliferation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining some adjuvants like MPL plus Alum and MPL plus MDP exert additive effects that impact on the magnitude and quality of humoral responses while mixing MDP with poly (I:C) or with R848 had no impact on total IgG titers but highly impact IgG subclass. In addition, heterologous DNA prime- protein boost yielded higher IgG titers when compare to DNA alone and improved the quality of humoral response when compare to protein immunization as evidenced by IgG1/IgG2a ratio. The results presented in this paper highlight the importance of selecting the correct adjuvant-antigen combination to potentiate desired cells for optimal stimulation.},

A first version (v1.0) of this web service focuses on the interaction of DNA, RNA and hybrid base pairs linked by two or three hydrogen bonds with water, cations and/or anions. Data provided by SwS are updated on a weekly basis and can be used by: (i) those involved in molecular dynamics simulation studies for validation purposes; (ii) crystallographers for help in the interpretation of solvent density maps; and all those involved in (iii) drug design and, more generally, in (iv) nucleic acid structural studies. SwS provides also statistical data related to the frequency of occurrence of different types of base pairs in crystallographic structures and the conformation of the involved nucleotides. This web service has been designed to allow a maximum of flexibility in terms of queries and has also been developed with didactic considerations in mind.

Foremost among the models used to elucidate the electrostatic potential is the Poisson-Boltzmann equation; however, existing methods for solving this equation have limited the scope of accurate electrostatic calculations to relatively small biomolecular systems. Here we present the application of numerical methods to enable the trivially parallel solution of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation for supramolecular structures that are orders of magnitude larger in size. As a demonstration of this methodology, electrostatic potentials have been calculated for large microtubule and ribosome structures. The results point to the likely role of electrostatics in a variety of activities of these structures.},

It is designed to simplify data processing by dividing the process into a series of steps, which are normally carried out sequentially. Each step has its own display pane, allowing control over parameters that influence that step and providing graphical feedback to the user. Suitable values for integration parameters are set automatically, but additional menus provide a detailed level of control for experienced users. The image display and the interfaces to the different tasks (indexing, strategy calculation, cell refinement, integration and history) are described. The most important parameters for each step and the best way of assessing success or failure are discussed.},

   Abstract = {We have carried out an extended reference set of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations (63 simulations with 8.4 mus of simulation data) of canonical A-RNA duplexes. Most of the simulations were done using the latest variant of the Cornell et al. AMBER RNA force field bsc0chi(OL3), while several other RNA force fields have been tested. The calculations show that the A-RNA helix compactness, described mainly by geometrical parameters inclination, base pair roll, and helical rise, is sequence-dependent. In the calculated set of structures, the inclination varies from 10 degrees to 24 degrees . On the basis of simulations with modified bases (inosine and 2,6-diaminopurine), we suggest that the sequence-dependence of purely canonical A-RNA double helix is caused by the steric shape of the base pairs, i.e., the van der Waals interactions. The electrostatic part of stacking does not appear to affect the A-RNA shape. Especially visible is the role of the minor groove amino group of purines. This resembles the so-called Dickerson-Calladine mechanical rules suggested three decades ago for the DNA double helices. We did not identify any long-living backbone substate in A-RNA double helices that would resemble, for example, the B-DNA BI/BII dynamics. The variability of the A-RNA compactness is due to mutual movements of the consecutive base pairs coupled with modest change of the glycosidic chi torsion. The simulations further show that the A-RNA compactness is modestly affected by the water model used, while the effect of ionic conditions, investigated in the range from net-neutral condition to ~0.8 M monovalent ion excess salt, is smaller.},

   Abstract = {We present a novel topological classification of RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots. It is based on the topological genus of the circular diagram associated to the RNA base-pair structure. The genus is a positive integer number whose value quantifies the topological complexity of the folded RNA structure. In such a representation, planar diagrams correspond to pure RNA secondary structures and have zero genus, whereas non-planar diagrams correspond to pseudoknotted structures and have higher genus. The topological genus allows for the definition of topological folding motifs, similar in spirit to those introduced and commonly used in protein folding. We analyze real RNA structures from the databases Worldwide Protein Data Bank and Pseudobase and classify them according to their topological genus. For simplicity, we limit our analysis by considering only Watson-Crick complementary base pairs and G-U wobble base pairs. We compare the results of our statistical survey with existing theoretical and numerical models. We also discuss possible applications of this classification and show how it can be used for identifying new RNA structural motifs.},

   Abstract = {Historically, it has been assumed that double-stranded (ds) RNAs function at a cellular level exclusively via an interferon (IFN) induction mechanism. However, current studies conducted both in the laboratory and at the clinical level reveal that this assumption is incorrect and, indeed, underestimates the intrinsic antitumor activity of certain dsRNAs. A specific dsRNA (Ampligen) shows strong antiproliferative activity against human carcinoid tumor cells in a clonogenic assay when natural alpha- and beta-IFNs were inactive. Similarly, in vivo studies in which human renal cancer cells were transplanted into athymic mice demonstrate a strong antitumor effect of Ampligen whereas such tumors are largely unaffected by alpha-IFN treatment. In a comparative study including many fresh human tumors of various histological types (breast, ovarian, melanoma, renal, and carcinoid) numerous examples were uncovered of Ampligen sensitivity (antiproliferative effect) in the face of relative or complete insensitivity to IFNs. Synergistic effects of Ampligen plus IFN overcame the resistance of some human tumor cells to either biological modifier given alone. It can also be demonstrated that the antitumor action of Ampligen on certain human lung tumor cells is not shared by polyinosinic . polycytidylic acid, thus indicating that different dsRNAs may themselves exhibit dissimilar effects on various human tumors.},

   Abstract = {Historically, double-stranded (ds) RNAs have been largely over-looked as potentially valuable anticancer/antiviral drugs, primarily because of the many clinical toxicities and lack of efficacy associated with the first clinically tested dsRNA--polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (rIn X rCn). However, studies summarized herein demonstrate that the therapeutic ratio of dsRNAs can be greatly enhanced by purposeful mispairing of bases. For example, a mispaired dsRNA, termed Ampligen (rIn X r(C12,U)n), shows strong antitumor activity in a variety of relevant test systems with little or none of the toxicities associated with rIn X rCn. Furthermore, Ampligen demonstrates a much wider therapeutic spectrum than that displayed to date by any single type of interferon (natural or recombinant DNA-derived). Importantly, Ampligen, the product of a straight-forward enzymatic synthesis, shows excellent lot-to-lot biological and biophysical specifications, which is often not the case with biologically derived new compounds. Furthermore, a significant fraction of human solid tumors, which are largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapy or interferon (IFN), is sensitive to Ampligen in a fresh human tumor clonogenic assay. Indeed, whereas 50% of untreated and IFN-treated athymic mice engrafted with human renal cancer cells die within 20-22 weeks, mice treated with Ampligen survive a minimum of 32 weeks (p less than 0.0003). A summary of all animal models tested and human clinical trials to date demonstrates that Ampligen exerts a greater antitumor activity than IFN and has a superior therapeutic ratio compared to rIn X rCn.},

   Abstract = {Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) are stromal precursors endowed with extensive immunomodulative properties. In this study, we aimed to assess whether Toll-like receptor-3 (TLR3)- and TLR4-activated BM-MSC influence human neutrophil (PMN) responses under coculture conditions. We show that TLR3 triggering by polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid dramatically amplifies, in a more significant manner than TLR4 triggering by lipopolysaccharide, the antiapoptotic effects that resting BM-MSC constitutively exert on PMN under coculture conditions, preserving a significant fraction of viable and functional PMN up to 72 hours. In addition, TLR3- and TLR4-activated BM-MSC enhance respiratory burst ability and CD11b expression by PMN. The coculture in the absence of cell contact and the incubation of PMN in supernatants harvested from TLR3- and TLR4-activated BM-MSC yield comparable results in terms of increased survival and immunophenotypic changes, thus suggesting the involvement of endogenous soluble factors. Neutralizing experiments reveal that the biological effects exerted on PMN by TLR3-activated BM-MSC are mediated by the combined action of interleukin 6, interferon-âÃ©Â¬â¤ (IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤), and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), while those exerted by TLR4-activated BM-MSC mostly depend on GM-CSF. MSC isolated from thymus, spleen, and subcutaneous adipose tissue behaves similarly. Finally, the effects exerted by TLR3- or TLR4-stimulated BM-MSC on PMN are conserved even after the previous priming of BM-MSC with IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ and tumor necrosis factor-âÃ©Â¬Â±. Our data highlight a novel mechanism by which MSC sustain and amplify the functions of PMN in response to TLR3- and TLR4-triggering and may consequently contribute to inflammatory disorders.},

   Abstract = {Group I self-splicing introns catalyze sequential transesterification reactions within an RNA transcript to produce the correctly spliced product. Often several hundred nucleotides in size, these ribozymes fold into specific three-dimensional structures that confer activity. The 2.8 A crystal structure of a central component of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, the 160-nucleotide P4-P6 domain, provides the first detailed view of metal binding in an RNA large enough to exhibit side-by-side helical packing. The long-range contacts and bound ligands that stabilize this fold can now be examined in detail.\\ Heavy-atom derivatives used for the structure determination reveal characteristics of some of the metal-binding sites in the P4-P6 domain. Although long-range RNA-RNA contacts within the molecule primarily involve the minor groove, osmium hexammine binds at three locations in the major groove. All three sites involve G and U nucleotides exclusively; two are formed by G.U wobble base pairs. In the native RNA, two of the sites are occupied by fully-hydrated magnesium ions. Samarium binds specifically to the RNA by displacing a magnesium ion in a region critical to the folding of the entire domain.\\ Bound at specific sites in the P4-P6 domain RNA, osmium (III) hexammine produced the high-quality heavy-atom derivative used for structure determination. These sites can be engineered into other RNAs, providing a rational means of obtaining heavy-atom derivatives with hexammine compounds. The features of the observed metal-binding sites expand the known repertoire of ligand-binding motifs in RNA, and suggest that some of the conserved tandem G.U base pairs in ribosomal RNAs are magnesium-binding sites.},

   Abstract = {Polyinosinic acid:polycytidylic acid, known as poly (I:C), is an analogue of doubleâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²stranded RNA, which exhibits direct antitumor effects against several types of cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of poly (I:C) in the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells. The HeLa human cervical cancer cell line was used in the present study, and cell apoptosis was determined following poly (I:C) transfection. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of interferon (IFN)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, mitochondrial membrane potential (âÂ¢ÃÃâÃâ âÃ©Â¬Â®m) and the release of cytochrome c, as well as caspase activation, were determined. The effect of IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤ on poly (I:C) transfectionâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²mediated apoptosis was also examined by IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤ knockdown. The results showed that poly (I:C) transfection markedly induced HeLa apoptosis, increased the protein levels of proâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²apoptotic B cell lymphomaâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²2 (BclâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²2)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²associated X protein (Bax) and BH3 interactingâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²domain death agonist (Bid), and suppressed the protein expression levels of antiâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²apoptotic BclâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²2 and Survivin. However, poly (I:C) transfection increased the mRNA levels of IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤, induced ROS production and increased the levels of phosphorylated âÃ©Â¬â¥H2A.X, an indicator of DNA damage. In addition, poly (I:C) transfection decreased âÂ¢ÃÃâÃâ âÃ©Â¬Â®m, triggered the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and induced caspaseâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²9 and âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²3 activation. IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤ knockdown decreased the poly (I:C)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²induced production of ROS and DNA damage, restored âÂ¢ÃÃâÃâ âÃ©Â¬Â®m and cytochrome c release, and suppressed caspaseâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²9 and âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²3 activation, thereby suppressing poly (I:C)âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²mediated apoptosis in the HeLa cells. Together, the results of the present study demonstrated that poly (I:C) transfection induced IFNâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²âÃ©Â¬â¤, contributing to ROS production, DNA damage, and caspaseâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²9 and âÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²3 activation in the HeLa cervical cancer cell line, leading to mitochondrialâÂ¢âÃÂ¨âÃÃ²mediated apoptosis.},

   Abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) perform a number of functions in different immunological settings. In standard in vitro experiments, DCs are produced from mouse bone marrow (BM) cells in the presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4. Our previous study demonstrated that BM precursor cells could differentiate into MDSCs when co-cultured with poly (I:C). In the present study, BM precursor cells cultured in GM-CSF and IL-4 were treated with CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG ODN). We observed that Gr1+CD11b+ cells exhibiting MDSC functions accumulated in the co-culture system. A similar phenomenon was also observed in Listeria monocytogenes-infected mice. In conclusion, we demonstrated that prolonged CpG ODN stimulation could inhibit the development of DCs and induce the differentiation of BM precursor cells into MDSCs.},

   Abstract = {The full-length cDNA coding for a novel invertebrate (i-type) lysozyme was identified in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). The newly obtained L. vannamei lysozyme is similar to the Penaeus monodon i-type lysozyme 2, but it is distant from the known L. vannamei c-type lysozyme and i-type lysozyme 1 in protein sequence; therefore, it was defined as L. vannamei i-type lysozyme 2 (lyz-i2). Expression of L. vannamei lyz-i2 transcripts were ubiquitously detected in all tissues we selected, with the highest abundance observed in the hemolymph. Challenge with Vibrio harveyi might elicit L. vannamei lyz-i2 mRNA expression in the hepatopancreas, intestine, muscle, gill and hemolymph. In the themolymph, specifically, the stimulatory effects of Vibrio and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on lyz-i2 transcript levels were durable and transient, respectively; while Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] treatment did not affect lyz-i2 expression. L. vannamei lyz-i2 recombinant protein was generated in an Escherichia coli system. By lysoplate and turbidimetric assays, the L. vannamei lyz-i2 recombinant protein showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties with high activities against Micrococcaceae lysodeikticus and various Vibrio species and relatively low activity against E. coli. In conclusion, L. vannamei lyz-i2 might be a potent antibacterial protein with a role in innate immunity in Penaeid shrimp.},

   Abstract = {Several biological response modifiers (BRMs) were demonstrated to increase myelopoiesis and effector cell responses (M phi and natural killer cell activity) in vivo. The increased myelopoiesis was reflected by an increase in bone marrow cellularity and granulocyte-M phi colony-forming cells (GM-CFU-C). The increase in myelopoiesis appeared to be related to a concomitant increase in colony-stimulated factor (CSF) production and secretion by M phi and bone marrow cells. CSF induction by BRMs increased myelopoiesis and counteracted the myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive effects of cyclophosphamide. CSF induced in vivo by BRMs attained high titers and were maintained over a longer period than exogenously injected CSF, which was rapidly cleared from serum.},

   Abstract = {As biochemists, one of our most captivating teaching 	tools is the use of molecular visualization. It is a compelling 	medium that can be used to communicate structural information much 	more effectively with interactive animations than with static 	figures. We have conducted a survey to begin a systematic evaluation 	of the current classroom usage of molecular visualization. 	Participants (n = 116) were asked to complete 11 multiple choice and 	3 open ended questions. To provide more depth to these results, 	interviews were conducted with 12 of the participants. Many common 	themes arose in the survey and the interviews: a shared passion for 	the use of molecular visualization in teaching, broad diversity in 	software preference, the lack of uniform standards for assessment, a 	desire for more quality resources, and the challenge of enabling 	students to incorporate visualization in their learning. The 	majority of respondents had used molecular visualization for more 	than 5 years and mentioned 32 different visualization tools used, 	with Jmol and PyMOL clearly standing out as the most frequently used 	programs at the present time. The most common uses of molecular 	visualization in teaching were lecture and lab illustrations, 	followed by exam questions, in-class or in-laboratory exercises, and 	student projects, which frequently included presentations. While a 	minority of instructors used a grading rubric/scoring matrix for 	assessment of student learning with molecular visualization, many 	expressed a desire for common use assessment tools.},

  abstract       = {We used small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to evaluate the solution structure of a double-stranded RNA with 32 base pairs. We wanted to compare the solution structure to the crystal structure to assess the impact of the crystal lattice on the overall conformation of the RNA. The RNA was designed to self-anneal and form a head-to-head fusion of two identical mRNA/oligo(U) tail domains (the U-helix) from a trypanosome RNA editing substrate formed by the annealing of a guide RNA to a pre-edited mRNA. This substrate is from the U insertion/deletion RNA editing system of trypanosomes. Each strand in the fusion RNA had 16 purines from the pre-mRNA followed by 16 uracils (Us) from the U-tail at the 3' end of the guide RNA. The strands were designed to form a double helix with blunt ends, but each strand had the potential to form hairpins and single-stranded RNA helices. Hairpins could form by the 3' oligouridylate tract folding back to hybridize with the 5' oligopurine tract and forming an intervening loop. Single-stranded helices could form by the stacking of bases in the polypurine tract. Some of the 16 Us 3' to the polypurine tract may have been unstacked and in random coils. Our SAXS studies showed that the RNA formed a mix of single-stranded structures in the absence of MgCl2. In the presence of MgCl2 at concentrations similar to those in the crystal, the solution structure was consistent with the double-stranded, blunt-ended structure, in agreement with the crystal structure. Here we describe the preparation of RNA samples, data collection with an in-house SAXS instrument designed for biological samples, and the processing and modeling of the scattering data.},

   Abstract = {A functionally responsive natural killer (NK)-cell repertoire requires the acquisition of inhibitory NKG2A and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) through pathways that remain undefined. Functional donor NK cells expressing KIRs for non-self class I MHC ligands contribute to a positive outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) by targeting HLA-matched recipient leukemic cells. Insofar as circulating donor conventional dendritic cells (DC) reconstitute with comparable kinetics with donor NK cells after alloHSCT, we used hyporesponsive KIRnegNKG2Aneg precursor cells to evaluate how specific DC subtypes generate a functionally active NK-cell repertoire. Both monocyte-derived DCs (moDC) and Langerhans-type DCs (LC) induce KIRnegNKG2Aneg precursor cells to express the inhibitory receptors NKG2A and KIR, without requiring cell proliferation. Poly(I:C)-matured moDCs significantly augmented the expression of NKG2A, but not KIR, in an IL12p70-dependent manner. Although all DC-stimulated KIRnegNKG2Aneg cells were able to acquire cytolytic activity against class I MHC-negative targets, the ability to secrete IFNâÃ©Â¬â¥ was restricted to cells that were stimulated by IL12p70-producing, poly(I:C)-matured moDCs. This critical ability of poly(I:C)-matured moDCs to provide IL12p70 to developing KIRnegNKG2Aneg precursors results in a dom4inant, multifunctional, NKG2Apos NK-cell population that is capable of both cytolysis and IFNâÃ©Â¬â¥ production. Poly(I:C)-matured moDCs are, therefore, the most effective conventional DC subtype for generating a functionally competent NK-cell repertoire by an IL12p70-dependent mechanism.},

   Abstract = {Human papillomaviruses (HPV) establish persistent infections because of evolved immune evasion mechanisms, particularly HPV-mediated suppression of the immune functions of Langerhans cells (LC), the antigen presenting cells of the epithelium. Polyinosinic-polycytidilic acid (Poly-I:C) is broadly immunostimulatory with the ability to enhance APC expression of costimulatory molecules and inflammatory cytokines resulting in T cell activation. Here we investigated the activation of primary human LC derived from peripheral blood monocytes after exposure to HPV16 virus like particles followed by treatment with stabilized Poly-I:C compounds (s-Poly-I:C), and their subsequent induction of HPV16-specific T cells. Our results indicate that HPV16 particles alone were incapable of inducing LC activation as demonstrated by the lack of costimulatory molecules, inflammatory cytokines, chemokine-directed migration, and HPV16-specific CD8(+) T cells in vitro. Conversely, s-Poly-I:C caused significant upregulation of costimulatory molecules and induction of chemokine-directed migration of LC that were pre-exposed to HPV16. In HLA-A*0201-positive donors, s-Poly-I:C treatment was able to induce CD8(+) T cell immune responses against HPV16-derived peptides. Thus, s-Poly-I:C compounds are attractive for translation into therapeutics in which they could potentially mediate clearance of persistent HPV infection.},

   Abstract = {To investigate the accuracy of a model [Giese et al., 1998, Biochemistry37:1094-1100 and Mathews et al., 1999, JMol Biol 288:911-940] that predicts the stability of RNA hairpin loops, optical melting studies were conducted on sets of hairpins previously determined to have unusually stable thermodynamic parameters. Included were the tetraloops GNRA and UNCG (where N is any nucleotide and R is a purine), hexaloops with UU first mismatches, and the hairpin loop of the iron responsive element, CAGUGC. The experimental values for the GNRA loops are in excellent agreement (deltaG degrees 37 within 0.2 kcal/mol and melting temperature (TM) within 4 degrees C) with the values predicted by the model. When the UNCG hairpin loops are treated as tetraloops, and a bonus of 0.8 kcal/mol included in the prediction to account for the extra stable first mismatch (UG), the measured and predicted values are also in good agreement (deltaG degrees 37 within 0.7 kcal/mol and TM within 3 degrees C). Six hairpins with unusually stable UU first mismatches also gave good agreement with the predictions (deltaG degrees 37 within 0.5 kcal/mol and TM within 8 degrees C), except for hairpins closed by wobble base pairs. For these hairpins, exclusion of the additional stabilization term for UU first mismatches improved the prediction (AG degrees 37 within 0.1 kcal/mol and TM within 3 degrees C). Hairpins with the iron-responsive element loop were not predicted well by the model, as measured deltaG degrees 37 values were at least 1 kcal/mol greater than predicted.},

It provides detailed all-atom contact analysis of any steric problems within the molecules as well as updated dihedral-angle diagnostics, and it can calculate and display the H-bond and van der Waals contacts in the interfaces between components. An integral step in the process is the addition and full optimization of all hydrogen atoms, both polar and nonpolar. New analysis functions have been added for RNA, for interfaces, and for NMR ensembles. Additionally, both the web site and major component programs have been rewritten to improve speed, convenience, clarity and integration with other resources. MolProbity results are reported in multiple forms: as overall numeric scores, as lists or charts of local problems, as downloadable PDB and graphics files, and most notably as informative, manipulable 3D kinemage graphics shown online in the KiNG viewer. This service is available free to all users at http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Bcl-XL binds to Bax, inhibiting Bax oligomerization required for mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) during apoptosis. How Bcl-XL binds to Bax in the membrane is not known. Here, we investigated the structural organization of Bcl-XLÂ¬âBax complexes formed in the MOM, including the binding interface and membrane topology, using site-specific cross-linking, compartment-specific labeling, and computational modeling. We found that one heterodimer interface is formed by a specific interaction between the Bcl-2 homology 1-3 (BH1-3) groove of Bcl-XL and the BH3 helix of Bax, as defined previously by the crystal structure of a truncated Bcl-XL protein and a Bax BH3 peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 3PL7). We also discovered a novel interface in the heterodimer formed by equivalent interactions between the helix 1 regions of Bcl-XL and Bax when their helical axes are oriented either in parallel or antiparallel. The two interfaces are located on the cytosolic side of the MOM, whereas helix 9 of Bcl-XL is embedded in the membrane together with helices 5, 6, and 9 of Bax. Formation of the helix 1Â¬âhelix 1 interface partially depends on the formation of the grooveÂ¬âBH3 interface because point mutations in the latter interface and the addition of ABT-737, a groove-binding BH3 mimetic, blocked the formation of both interfaces. The mutations and ABT-737 also prevented Bcl-XL from inhibiting Bax oligomerization and subsequent MOMP, suggesting that the structural organization in which interactions at both interfaces contribute to the overall stability and functionality of the complex represents antiapoptotic Bcl-XLÂ¬âBax complexes in the MOM.},

   Abstract = {Continuum solvation models, such as Poisson-Boltzmann and Generalized Born methods, have become increasingly popular tools for investigating the influence of electrostatics on biomolecular structure, energetics and dynamics. However, the use of such methods requires accurate and complete structural data as well as force field parameters such as atomic charges and radii. Unfortunately, the limiting step in continuum electrostatics calculations is often the addition of missing atomic coordinates to molecular structures from the Protein Data Bank and the assignment of parameters to biomolecular structures. To address this problem, we have developed the PDB2PQR web service (http://agave.wustl.edu/pdb2pqr/). This server automates many of the common tasks of preparing structures for continuum electrostatics calculations, including adding a limited number of missing heavy atoms to biomolecular structures, estimating titration states and protonating biomolecules in a manner consistent with favorable hydrogen bonding, assigning charge and radius parameters from a variety of force fields, and finally generating 'PQR' output compatible with several popular computational biology packages. This service is intended to facilitate the setup and execution of electrostatics calculations for both experts and non-experts and thereby broaden the accessibility to the biological community of continuum electrostatics analyses of biomolecular systems.},

   Abstract = {Drawing from the growing database of complex three-dimensional RNA structures, a systematic method has been developed for classifying and analyzing the variety of conformations adopted by nucleic acids. This method is based on the development of a reduced representation for nucleic acid backbone conformation, simplifying the formidable eight-dimensional problem that has long complicated nucleic acid conformational analysis. Two pseudotorsion angles (eta and theta) have been defined, based on the selection of two appropriate pivot points along the RNA backbone, P and C4'. These pseudotorsions, together with a complete library of conventional torsion angles, can be calculated for any RNA structure or all-atom model using a new program called AMIGOS. Having computed eta and theta pseudotorsions for each position on an RNA molecule, they can be represented on a two-dimensional plot similar to the phi-phi plots that have traditionally been used for protein conformational analysis. Like a Ramachandran plot, clusters of residues appear at discrete regions on an eta-theta plot. Nucleotides within these clusters share conformational properties, of ten belonging to the same type of structural motif such as A-platforms, sheared tandem purine-purine pairs and GNRA tetraloops. An eta-theta plot provides a two-dimensional representation of the conformational properties of an entire RNA molecule, facilitating rapid analysis of structural features. Ln addition to the utility of eta-theta plots for intuitive visualization of conformational space, the pseudotorsional convention described here should significantly simplify approaches to macromolecular modeling of RNA structure.

   Abstract = {The single-crystal structures are presented for two DNA sequences with the thymine bases covalently cross-linked across the complementary strands by 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (HMT). The HMT-adduct of d(CCGCTAGCGG) forms a psoralen-induced Holliday junction, showing for the first time the effect of this important class of chemotheraputics on the structure of the recombination intermediate. In contrast, HMT-d(CCGGTACCGG) forms a sequence-dependent junction. In both structures, the DNA duplex is highly distorted at the thymine base linked to the six-member pyrone ring of the drug. The psoralen cross-link defines the intramolecular interactions of the drug-induced junction, while the sequence-dependent structure is nearly identical to the native Holliday junction of d(CCGGTACCGG) alone. The two structures contrast the effects of drug- and sequence-dependent interactions on the structure of a Holliday junction, suggesting a role for psoralen in the mechanism to initiate repair of psoralen-lesions in mammalian DNA.},

   Abstract = {Holliday junctions are important structural intermediates in recombination, viral integration, and DNA repair. We present here the single-crystal structure of the inverted repeat sequence d(CCGGTACCGG) as a Holliday junction at the nominal resolution of 2. 1 A. Unlike the previous crystal structures, this DNA junction has B-DNA arms with all standard Watson-Crick base pairs; it therefore represents the intermediate proposed by Holliday as being involved in homologous recombination. The junction is in the stacked-X conformation, with two interconnected duplexes formed by coaxially stacked arms, and is crossed at an angle of 41.4 degrees as a right-handed X. A sequence comparison with previous B-DNA and junction crystal structures shows that an ACC trinucleotide forms the core of a stable junction in this system. The 3'-C x G base pair of this ACC core forms direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds to the phosphates at the crossover strands. Interactions within this core define the conformation of the Holliday junction, including the angle relating the stacked duplexes and how the base pairs are stacked in the stable form of the junction.},

After scaling, the intensities can be analysed to set the real resolution of the data set, to detect bad regions (e.g. bad images), to analyse radiation damage and to assess the overall quality of the data set. The significance of any anomalous signal may be assessed by probability and correlation analysis. The algorithms used by the CCP4 scaling program SCALA are described. A requirement for the scaling and merging of intensities is knowledge of the Laue group and point-group symmetries: the possible symmetry of the diffraction pattern may be determined from scores such as correlation coefficients between observations which might be symmetry-related. These scoring functions are implemented in a new program POINTLESS.},

   Abstract = {The gene for cytochrome oxidase subunit III (COIII) is not detected in T. brucei by nucleotide sequence analysis or by cross-hybridization studies. We have identified the COIII transcript in the T. brucei mitochondrion by RNA and cDNA sequencing. Its nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences are very similar to those from the COIII genes in related species. A mitochondrial DNA sequence that matches the COIII transcript, except for the absence of numerous thymidines, is located upstream of the apocytochrome b gene, the position of the COIII gene in related species. We conclude that this sequence is the COIII gene and that over 50% of the T. brucei COIII transcript sequence is created by RNA editing.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Features of the land management history over a 125,755 km(2) area of central Queensland, Australia were determined from a variety of sources. A random sample of 205 site locations provided the basis for determining trends in land use. Trends in vegetation clearing were determined using sequential aerial photography for the sample sites, revealing a steady rate averaging nearly 1% of the region per annum over 41 years. This measure of sustained clearing over a large region is higher than recently published clearing rates from South America. Land types have been selectively cleared with over 90% of the Acacia on clay land type having been cleared. A land-holder questionnaire pertaining to the random sites yielded a response rate of 71% and provided information on vegetation clearing, ploughing, tree killing (ring-barking or tree poisoning), and fire frequency, season and intensity. The land-holder responses were compared with independent data sources where possible and revealed no mis-information. However, land-holders may have been marginally less likely to respond if the sample area had been cleared, although this effect was not statistically significant. Ploughing and tree killing are variable depending on land type, but the former has affected about 40% of the Acacia on clay land type, effectively eliminating options for natural regrowth. The proportion of decade-site combinations that were reported as having no fires increased from 22% in the 1950s to an average of 42% for subsequent decades, although the reporting of more than one fire per decade has been relatively constant through the study period. The reporting of at least one fire per decade varies from 46% for the Acacia on sand land type to 77% for the Eucalypt on sand land type for decade-site combinations. Fires are more intense when associated with clearing than in uncleared vegetation, but the proportion of cool and hot fires is relatively constant between land types in uncleared vegetation. Nearly all fires reported were either in spring or summer and this seasonally restricted regime is probably at variance with Aboriginal fire regimes. This study describes the rapid transformation of central Queensland. This has yielded substantially increased agricultural production but may also result in a range of negative impacts and these are discussed.},

   Abstract = {Our objectives were to identify Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in human bone marrow derived adipocytes, to test specific TLR agonists for their ability to induce a proinflammatory response, and to investigate possible metabolic effects after TLR activation, in particular, those associated with insulin resistance and lipolysis. Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from human bone marrow and differentiated into adipocytes. Total RNA before or after stimulation with agonists specific for TLR was extracted for analysis of expression of TLRs proinflammatory signals and molecules involved in glucose metabolism (IRS-1 and GLUT4). Furthermore, cytokine protein expression was measured from cell lysates. Finally, insulin induced glucose uptake and lipolysis were measured. Human bone marrow-derived adipocytes express TLR1-10. They react to stimulation with specific ligands with expression of inflammatory markers (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNFalpha, IL-8, MCP-1) at the RNA and protein levels. IRS-1 and GLUT4 expression was downregulated after stimulation with the TLR4 and TLR3 specific ligands LPS and poly (I:C), respectively. Insulin-induced glucose uptake was decreased and lipolysis increased. We conclude that adipocytes express TLR 1-10 and react to agonists specific for TLR 1-6. As a consequence proinflammatory cytokine are induced, in particular, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1. Since stimulation is followed by decreased insulin-induced glucose uptake and increased lipolysis we conclude that TLRs may be important linking molecules in the generation of insulin resistance in fat tissue.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {In order to further explore the tolerance of proteins to amino acid substitutions within the interior, a series of core residues was replaced by methionine within the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme. By replacing leucine, isoleucine, valine and phenylalanine residues a total of 10 methionines could be introduced, which corresponds to a third of the residues that are buried in this domain. As more methionines are incorporated the protein gradually loses stability. This is attributed in part to a reduction in hydrophobic stabilization, in part to the increased entropic cost of localizing the long, flexible methionine sidechains, and in part to steric clashes. The changes in structure of the mutants relative to the wildtype protein are modest but tend to increase in an additive fashion as more methionines are included. In the most extreme case, namely the 10-methionine mutant, much of the C-terminal domain remains quite similar to wildtype (root-mean-square backbone shifts of 0.56 A), while the F and G helices undergo rotations of approximately 20 degrees and center-of-mass shifts of approximately 1.4 A. For up to six methionine substitutions the changes in stability are additive. Beyond this point, however, the multiple mutants are somewhat more stable than suggested from the sum of their constituents, especially for those including the replacement Val111-->Met. This is interpreted in terms of the larger structural changes associated with this substitution. The substituted sidechains in the mutant structures have somewhat higher crystallographic thermal factors than their counterparts in WT*. Nevertheless, the interiors of the mutant proteins retain a well-defined structure with little suggestion of molten-globule characteristics. Lysozymes in which selenomethionine has been incorporated rather than methionine tend to have increased stability. At the same time they also fold faster. This provides further evidence that, at the rate-limiting step in folding, the structure of the C-terminal domain of T4 lysozyme is similar to that of the fully folded protein.},

   Abstract = {An increasing number of recognition mechanisms in RNA are found to involve G.U base pairs. In order to detect new functional sites of this type, we exhaustively analyzed the sequence alignments and secondary structures of eubacterial and chloroplast 16S and 23S rRNA, seeking positions with high levels of G.U pairs. Approximately 120 such sites were identified and classified according to their secondary structure and sequence environment. Overall biases in the distribution of G.U pairs are consistent with previously proposed structural rules: the side of the wobble pair that is subject to a loss of stacking is preferentially exposed to a secondary structure loop, where stacking is not as essential as in helical regions. However, multiple sites violate these rules and display highly conserved G.U pairs in orientations that could cause severe stacking problems. In addition, three motifs displaying a conserved G.U pair in a specific sequence/structure environment occur at an unusually high frequency. These motifs, of which two had not been reported before, involve sequences 5'UG3' 3'GA5' and 5'UG3' 3'GU5', as well as G.U pairs flanked by a bulge loop 3' of U. The possible structures and functions of these recurrent motifs are discussed.},

   Abstract = {The effect of mouse serum interferon (IF) in vitro and an inducer in vivo on the proliferation of a pluripotent stem cell population with high turnover rate was studied. Proliferation rate was characterized by the number of CFUs in the S phase of the cell cycle. Increased proliferation of bone marrow stem cell populations was produced either by irradiating the donor mice with 3.36 Gy (336 rad) 60Co-gamma rays 7 days before the experiment or by incubating normal bone marrow cells with 10(-11) M concentration of isoproterenol. IF considerably reduced the number of CFUs in S phase in both cases without reducing the CFUs content of the samples. Injection of IF inducer (4 mg/kg poly I:C) into regenerating mice also inhibited the proliferation of CFUs without decreasing the femoral CFUs level. Regeneration kinetics of CFUs from irradiated poly I:C-treated mice ran parallel with that of irradiated untreated animals but showed a characteristic delay corresponding to approximately one CFUs doubling. A transient, non-cytotoxic proliferation inhibitory effect of IF or IF inducer is, therefore, proposed.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Thermodynamic parameters are reported for hairpin formation in 1 M NaCl by RNA sequences of the type GGXANmAYCC, where XY is the wobble base pair, GU or UG, and the underlined loop sequences are three to eight nucleotides. A nearest-neighbor analysis indicates the free energy of loop formation is dependent upon loop size and closing base pair. Hairpin loops closed by UG base pairs are on average 1.3 kcal/mol less stable than hairpins closed by GU base pairs. The hairpin loops closed by UG have approximately the same stability as hairpin loops closed by AU/UA base pairs, while the loops closed by GU are approximately 0.7 kcal/mol more stable than hairpins loops closed by GC/CG base pairs. These results, combined with the model previously developed [Serra et al. (1997) Biochemistry 36, 4844] to predict the stability for hairpin loops closed by Watson-Crick base pairs, allow for the following model to predict the stability of hairpin loops: delta G degree 37L(n) = delta G degree 37iL(n) + delta G degree 37mm + 0.6 (if closed by AU, UA, or UB) - 0.7 (if closed by GU) - 0.7 (if first mismatch is GA or UU except for loops closed by GU). Here, delta G degree 37iL(n) is the free energy increment for initiating a loop of n nucleotides with a CG or GC pair, and delta G degree 37mm is the free energy for the interaction of the first mismatch with the closing base pair. For hairpin loops of n = 4-9, delta G037iL(n) is 4.9, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.9, and 5.5 kcal/mol, respectively. For hairpin loops of n = 3, delta G degree 37L(3) = +4.8 + 0.6 (if closed by AU, UA, or UG) kcal/mol. Thermodynamic parameters for hairpin formation in 1 M NaCl for 13 naturally occurring RNA hairpin sequences closed by wobble base pairs are reported. The model provides good agreement for both TM and delta G degree 37 for most hairpins studied. Thermodynamic values for five terminal mismatches adjacent to wobble base pairs are also reported.},

   Abstract = {Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening gastrointestinal disease in premature infants with high mortality and morbidity with uncertain pathogenesis. Recent research focused on the role of intraluminal bacteria and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, an additional role of viral agents in the pathogenesis of NEC has recently been postulated. We assessed the role of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pIC) mimicking viral dsRNA in contributing to the development of NEC in neonatal mice.\\ Four-d-old C57BL/6J pups were stressed by asphyxia and hypothermia twice daily. Animals were either fed by formula only (FO), formula containing LPS or pIC. After 72 h, mice were euthanized, intestines harvested, and the severity of NEC was assessed.\\ Breastfed mice showed no evidence of NEC. Very mild NEC-like lesions were observed in mice fed by FO. Supplementation of LPS or pIC to the formula led to increased intestinal tissue damage and inflammation compared with FO in a similar manner.\\ Our study demonstrates the ability of viral factors to induce NEC in neonatal mice even in the absence of LPS. Furthermore, we present a new mouse model of pIC-induced NEC which may be used to obtain further mechanistic insights in the pathogenesis of this disease.},

   Abstract = {The control of gene transcription by antigene oligonucleotides rests upon the specific recognition of double-helical DNA by triplex-forming oligonucleotides. The development of the antigene strategy requires access to the targeted DNA sequence within the chromatin structure of the cell nucleus. In this sudy we have used HIV-1 chronically infected cells containing the HIV provirus as endogenous genes to demonstrate that the integrated HIV-1 proviral genome is accessible to triplex-forming oligonucleotides within cell nuclei. An oligonucleotide-psoralen conjugate targeted to the polypurine tract (PPT) of the HIV-1 proviral sequence was used as a tool to convert the noncovalent triple-helical complex into a covalent lesion on genomic DNA after UV irradiation of cells. Triplex-derived adducts were analyzed using two different methods. The photo-induced psoralen cross-link prevented cleavage of the target sequence by DraI restriction endonuclease, and the sequence-specific inhibition of cleavage was revealed and quantitated by Southern blot analysis. A quantitative analysis of cross-linking efficiency was also carried out by a competitive PCR-based assay. These two approaches allowed us to demonstrate that a triplex-forming oligonucleotide can recognize and bind specifically to a 15-bp sequence within the chromatin structure of cell nuclei.},

   Abstract = {MicroRNAs are short (17-26) noncoding RNAs driving or modulating physiological and pathological cellular events. Overexpression of miR-155 is pathogenic in B-cell malignancy but was also reported in a number of solid tumors-in particular, in breast cancer, where its role remains unclear and often contradictory. Using representative cell line models, we sought to determine whether the discrepant miR-155 effects in breast cancer could be explained by the heterogeneity of the disease. The growth of six breast cancer cell lines transfected with several miRNA mimics was analyzed. We found MCF-7 cell growth to be inhibited by miR-155 and miR-145 mimics, both 23-nt long, but not by a number of shorter mimics, including a universal commercial negative control. Microarray and Western blot analyses revealed induction of apoptosis, associated with interferon-âÃ©Â¬â¤ after activation of the double-stranded RNA sensor pathway. 3' Trimming of the miRNA mimics to 21 nt substantially reduced their growth-inhibitory potency. Mutating the canonical seed of the miR-155 mimic had no effect on the induced inhibition, which was abolished by mutating the miRNA seed of the artificial passenger strand. A panel of breast cancer cell lines showed a wide range of sensitivities to 23-mer mimics, broadly consistent with the sensitivity of the cell lines to Poly (I:C). We demonstrate two sources for nonspecific in vitro effects by miRNA mimics: duplex length and the artificial passenger strand. We highlight the danger of a universal 21-mer negative control and the importance of using matched seed mutants for reliable interpretation of phenotypes.},

   Abstract = {Synthetic double stranded RNA (Poly(I:C)) injection of Crassostrea gigas results in a systemic antiviral response involving many evolutionary conserved antiviral effectors (ISGs). Compared to mammals, the timing of C. gigas ISG expression to viral or poly(I:C) injection is delayed (>12 h p.i.). It could be interpreted that a cytokine is responsible for the systemic, but delayed expression of C. gigas ISGs. We therefore analysed the acellular fraction of C. gigas hemolymph by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) to identify hemolymph proteins induced by poly(I:C). Poly(I:C) injection increased the relative intensity of four protein spots. These protein spots were identified by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as a small heat shock protein (sHSP), poly(I:C)-inducible protein 1 (PIP1) and two isoforms of C1q-domain containing protein (C1qDC). RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that the genes encoding these proteins are induced in hemocytes of C. gigas injected with poly(I:C) (p < 0.05). Proteomic data from this experiment corroborates previous microarray and whole transcriptome studies that have reported up-regulation of C1qDC and sHSP during mass mortality events among farmed oysters.},

   Abstract = {Many viral proteins exhibit selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells without affecting the normal diploid cells. The apoptin protein of chicken infectious anemia virus is one of such proteins, which has been shown to kill tumor cells specifically. However, an effective cancer treatment strategy also requires assistance from the immune system. Recently, poly (I:C) has been shown to be an effective cancer vaccine adjuvant.\\ In this study, we assessed the anti-tumor potential of apoptin gene transfer alone and in combination with poly (I:C) in a 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model.\\ 4T1 cells were used to induce mammary tumor in Balb/c mice. Mice bearing tumors were divided into 6 groups, and each group received six intratumoral injections during a period of one month. After the last immunization, the animals were sacrificed, and peripheral blood, spleen, lungs, liver, heart, kidney and tumor tissues were collected for immunological, molecular and pathological analysis.\\ We report that intratumoral administration of apoptin plasmid along with poly (I:C) not only significantly inhibited the growth of mammary tumor, but also induced a potent anti-tumor immune response as indicated by the increase in blood CD4+, CD8+ cells and infiltration of immune cells in the tumor tissue. Further, blood serum analysis of the cytokines revealed increased secretion of Th1 cytokines (IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ and IL-2).\\ The results of our study demonstrate that the inclusion of poly (I:C) significantly enhanced the anti-tumor activity of apoptin mainly by inducing a potent anti-tumor immune response. Therefore, we report the use of apoptin and poly (I:C) combination as a novel and powerful strategy for cancer immunotherapy.},

   Abstract = {The canine parvovirus NS1 (CPV2.NS1) protein selectively induces apoptosis in the malignant cells. However, for an effective in vivo tumor treatment strategy, an oncolytic agent also needs to induce a potent anti-tumor immune response. In the present study, we used poly (I:C), a TLR3 ligand, as an adjuvant along with CPV2.NS1 to find out if the combination can enhance the oncolytic activity by inducing a potent anti-tumor immune response. The 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells were used to induce mammary tumor in Balb/c mice. The results suggested that poly (I:C), when given along with CPV2.NS1, not only significantly reduced the tumor growth but also augmented the immune response against tumor antigen(s) as indicated by the increase in blood CD4+ and CD8+ counts and infiltration of immune cells in the tumor tissue. Further, blood serum analysis of the cytokines revealed that Th1 cytokines (IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥ and IL-2) were significantly upregulated in the treatment group indicating activation of cell-mediated immune response. The present study reports the efficacy of CPV2.NS1 along with poly (I:C) not only in inhibiting the mammary tumor growth but also in generating an active anti-tumor immune response without any visible toxicity. The results of our study may help in developing CPV2.NS1 and poly (I: C) combination as a cancer therapeutic regime to treat various malignancies.},

   Abstract = {In 1985 an analysis of the Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA covariation-based structure model revealed a strong bias for unpaired adenosines. The same analysis revealed that the majority of the G, C, and U bases were paired. These biases are (now) consistent with the high percentage of unpaired adenosine nucleotides in several structure motifs. An analysis of a larger set of bacterial comparative 16 S and 23 S rRNA structure models has substantiated this initial finding and revealed new biases in the distribution of adenosine nucleotides in loop regions. The majority of the adenosine nucleotides are unpaired, while the majority of the G, C, and U bases are paired in the covariation-based structure model. The unpaired adenosine nucleotides predominate in the middle and at the 3' end of loops, and are the second most frequent nucleotide type at the 5' end of loops (G is the most common nucleotide). There are additional biases for unpaired adenosine nucleotides at the 3' end of loops and adjacent to a G at the 5' end of the helix. The most prevalent consecutive nucleotides are GG, GA, AG, and AA. A total of 70 % of the GG sequences are within helices, while more than 70 % of the AA sequences are unpaired. Nearly 50 % of the GA sequences are unpaired, and approximately one-third of the AG sequences are within helices while another third are at the 3' loop.5' helix junction. Unpaired positions with an adenosine nucleotide in more than 50 % of the sequences at the 3' end of 16 S and 23 S rRNA loops were identified and arranged into the A-motif categories XAZ, AAZ, XAG, AAG, and AAG:U, where G or Z is paired, G:U is a base-pair, and X is not an A and Z is not a G in more than 50 % of the sequences. These sequence motifs were associated with several structural motifs, such as adenosine platforms, E and E-like loops, A:A and A:G pairings at the end of helices, G:A tandem base-pairs, GNRA tetraloop hairpins, and U-turns.},

   Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) as endogenous small non-coding RNAs play key regulatory roles in diverse biological processes via degrading the target mRNAs or inhibiting protein translation. Previously many researchers have reported the identification, characteristic of miRNAs and the interaction with its target gene. But, the study on the regulation of miRNAs to biological processes via regulatory the key signaling pathway was still limited. In order to comprehend the regulatory mechanism of miRNAs, two small RNA libraries from the spleen of miiuy croaker individuals with or without poly(I:C) infection were constructed. The 197 conserved miRNAs and 75 novel miRNAs were identified, and 14 conserved and 8 novel miRNAs appeared significant variations. Those differently expressed miRNAs relate to immune regulation of miiuy croaker. Furthermore, expressions of four differently expressed miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR, and the result was consistent with sequencing data. The target genes of the differently expressed miRNAs in the two libraries were predicted, and some candidate target genes were involved in the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway. The negative regulation of miRNAs to target genes were confirmed by comparing the expression pattern of miRNAs and their target genes. The results of regulating target genes were that firstly directly or indirectly activating the downstream signaling cascades and subsequent inducting the type I interferon, inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. These studies could help us to deeper understand the roles of miRNAs played in the fish immune system, and provide a new way to investigate the defense mechanism of fish.},

   Abstract = {The 3D structures of macromolecules are difficult to 	grasp and also to communicate. By their nature, movies or animations 	are particularly useful for highlighting key features by offering a 	'guided tour' of structures and conformation changes. However, 	high-quality movies are rarely seen because they are currently 	difficult and time consuming to make. By adopting the traditional 	movie 'storyboard' concept, which gives guidance and direction to 	filming, eMovie makes the creation of lengthy molecular animations 	much easier. This tool is a plug-in for the open-source molecular 	graphics program PyMOL, and enables experts and novices alike to 	produce informative and high-quality molecular animations.},

Members of the tetraspanin family include CD9, CD37, CD63, CD53, and others. However, few tetraspanins have been investigated in teleosts. In this study, we obtained the open reading frame of CD53 cDNA from orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioices), an economically important fish. The predicted amino acid structure contains four membrane-spanning domains and a conserved CCG motif. The amino acid identity between human and grouper CD53 was only 38%; however, both CD53 proteins share the same structure. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that mRNA is abundant in immune organs, including the head and trunk kidneys, spleen, thymus, gill, and blood. Immunochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses further revealed that CD53 was majorly expressed in the leukocytes of various organs. Finally, mRNA and protein expression for CD53 was down-regulated in fish treated with immune stimulators, including LPS, Poly (I:C), Vibrio, recombinant grouper IL-6, and CCL4. Our results indicate that the expression of CD53 may play important roles in pathogen invasion and inflammation reaction.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {The RNP domain is a very common motif found in hundreds of proteins, including many protein components of the RNA processing machinery. The 70-90 amino acid domain contains two highly conserved stretches of 6-8 amino acids (RNP-1 and RNP-2) in the central strands of a four-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet, packed against two alpha-helices by a conserved hydrophobic core. Using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR, we have mapped intermolecular contacts between the human U1A protein 102 amino acid N-terminal RNP domain and a 31-mer oligonucleotide derived from stem-loop II of U1 snRNA. Chemical shift changes induced on the protein by the RNA define the surface of the beta-sheet as the recognition interface. The reverse face of the protein, with the two alpha-helices, remains exposed to the solvent in the presence of the RNA, and is potentially available for protein-protein contacts in spliceosome assembly or splice site selection. Protein-RNA contacts occur at the single-stranded apical loop of the hairpin, but also in the major groove of the helical stem at neighbouring U.G and U.U non-Watson-Crick base pairs. Examination of a proposed model for the complex in the light of the present results reveals several features of RNA recognition by RNP proteins. The quality of the spectra for this complex of 22 kDa demonstrates the feasibility of NMR investigation of RNA-protein complexes.},

   Abstract = {Germ cell apoptosis may be associated with the male infertility. The pathogenesis is to be further understood. Viral infection is one of the causative factors of apoptosis of the body cells. This study aims to investigate the role of activation of Toll like receptor (TLR)3 in the induction of germ cell apoptosis. In this study, spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) were isolated from C57BL/6 mouse testes. The expression of TLR3 on SSC was by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C) was employed to activate TLR3 on SSCs. The results showed that re-activation by PolyI:C induced SSC apoptosis. Exposure to PolyI:C induced interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) phosphorylation in SSCs. TLR3 and IRF3 formed a complex in the SSCs. The complex of TLR3/IRF3 bound to the promoter of Fas ligand and promoted Fas ligand expression in SSC, and thus induced SSC apoptosis. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that activation of TLR3 by PolyI:C induces the SSC apoptosis, which implies that viral infection may interfere with the male germ cell development.},

   Shorttitle = {Identification and function analysis of the three dsRBMs in the N terminal dsRBD of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) PKR},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {The protein kinase R (PKR) can inhibit protein translation and lead to apoptosis under the circumstances of virus invasion and multiple other stress conditions. PKR is a dsRNA binding protein with a dsRBD and a kinase domain (KD). dsRBD is mostly composed of two (in mammal PKR) or three (in some fish PKR) dsRNA binding motifs (dsRBMs). Multiple sequences alignment and Phylogenetic analysis indicate that the three dsRBMs of fish PKR share analogous structure but show to be divergence origination. In this study, we have identified and analyzed the three dsRBMs from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) PKR (CiPKR), which was cloned previously in our laboratory. dsRBMs of CiPKR have two or three conserved regions involved in dsRNA binding. Among the three dsRBMs, dsRBM1 was peculiar to some fish PKRs, while dsRBM2 and dsRBM3 were closely related to the dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 of mammal PKRs respectively. Dimerization assay indicated that dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 formed not only homo-dimer but also homo-multimer; whereas dsRBM3 formed merely homo-dimer. Meanwhile, dsRBM1-2, dsRBM2-3 and dsRBM1-2-3 could homo-dimerize and homo-multimerize also. Poly I:C pull-down assay showed that the binding of dsRBM to Poly I:C needed two or three dsRBMs to cooperate in vitro, meaning one dsRBM from CiPKR could not bind to dsRNA efficiently. To further investigate the effect of dsRBM on the function of CiPKR, we constructed pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-wt and a series of CiPKR mutants recombined plasmids including pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM2-3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1,3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1-2, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1. The recombined plasmids respectively were co-transfected with plasmid PGL3 promoter into CIK cells. In comparison with the control group, the luciferase translation inhibitions were 78.7%, 15%, 0, 0.5%, 61.8%, 67.3% respectively. The results indicated that the protein translation inhibition caused by CiPKR mutants with only one dsRBM were very weak, while those with two or three dsRBMs inhibited the protein translation powerfully. Cell viability were 34.2%, 98.2%, 112%, 108%, 50.3%, 47.5% respectively after transfected with pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-wt, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM2-3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1,3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1-2, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM3, pcDNA3.1/CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1 in order into CIK cells for 48 h. The results from cell counting also indicated that transfection of CiPKR-wt and the mutants CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM3, CiPKR-âÃ©âÃÃ¹dsRBM1 could inhibit the protein translation and facilitated the decrease of CIK cells number. In conclusion, our observations suggested that two dsRBMs ranking in tandem at N terminal were essential for the function of CiPKR, and the presence of the extra dsRBM1 enhanced its function.},

   Abstract = {Protein-based vaccine is promising to improve or replace Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine for its specificity, safety, and easy production. However, protein-based vaccine calls for potent adjuvants and improved delivery systems to protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Poly(I:C) is one of the most potent pathogen-associated molecular patterns that signals primarily via TLR3. Arabinogalactan (AG) is a biocompatible polysaccharide that can increase splenocyte proliferation and stimulate macrophages. The AG-poly(I:C) conjugate (AG-P) showed an adjuvant potency through a synergistic interaction of AG and poly(I:C). Ag85B and HspX are two important virulent protein antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Ag85B-HspX fusion protein (AH) was prepared. An antigen-adjuvant delivery system (AH-AG-P) was developed by conjugation of AH with AG-P to ensure that both AH and AG-P reach the APCs simultaneously. AH-AG-P elicited high AH-specific IgG titers and stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. AH-AG-P provoked the secretion of Th1-type cytokines (TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â±, IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¥, and IL-2) and Th2-type cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10). Pharmacokinetics revealed that conjugation with AG-P could prolong the serum exposure of AH to the immune system. Pharmacodynamics suggested that conjugation with AG-P led to a rapid and intense production of AH-specific IgG. Accordingly, conjugation with AG-P could promote a robust cellular and humoral immune response to AH. Thus, conjugation of AH with a potent adjuvant AG-P is an effective strategy to develop an efficacious protein-based vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.},

   Abstract = {Our study aimed to compare the curative effect and immunoregulation between MSCs activated by Poly(I:C) for 24hours and unactivated MSCs on lupus mice.\\ MSCs were pretreated by Poly(I:C) at 50âÃ©Â¬Âºg/mL for 24h. B6.MRL-Fas(lpr) mice were divided into UC-MSC treated group, FLS treated group, Poly(I:C) preconditioned MSC treated group (P-MSC) and untreated group randomly. All treated mice were infused with 1âÃâÃÃ®10(6) MSCs or FLSs at the 24th week and were sacrificed 4 weeks later. The spleen weight, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, serum anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels, immune cell subsets, renal lesions and IgG deposition in the kidney were evaluated. The effects of two kinds of MSCs on the proliferation and apoptosis of CD4+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry. The TLR3 expression at protein level in MSCs was assessed with and without Poly(I:C) treatment. The expression of immunoregulatory factors were detected by qRT-PCR in different dose and duration of Poly(I:C).\\ Poly(I:C) preconditioned MSCs had similar therapeutic effects in lupus mice compared with untreated MSCs in vivo. Furthermore, Poly(I:C) treated MSCs and untreated MSCs had comparable inhibitory effects on proliferation of T cells, and Poly(I:C) could enhance the expression of TLR3 at protein and mRNA level. Poly(I:C) could partly alter the mRNA levels of immunoregulatory factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor âÃ©Â¬â¤1, vascular endothelial growth factor, but did not have significant changes in cyclooxygenase 2, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor âÃ©Â¬Â±, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, interferon âÃ©Â¬â¥ and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2.\\ Our study did not find that Poly(I:C) treatment could enhance the therapeutic effect of MSCs in lupus mice in vivo.},

   Abstract = {Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising tools for such applications as tissue engineering and cellular therapy. It is not clear how stem cells exposed to unfavorable conditions (e.g., hypoxia or inflammation) respond to signals of danger after in vivo transplantation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a major role in the immune system, participating in the initial recognition of microbial pathogens and pathogen-associated components. This study was designated to determine the role of TLRs in human MSCs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that MSCs derived from human adipose tissue and bone marrow express TLR-1, TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, TLR-5, TLR-6, and TLR-9. We investigated induction of the differentiation and proliferation of human adipose tissue stromal cells (hADSCs) by TLR agonists, including flagellin, peptidoglycans (PGN), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the synthetic double-stranded RNA analog poly(I:C), and synthetic CpG oligodeoxydinucleotide (CpG-ODN). None of these agonists, except ODN, affected the proliferation of hADSCs. LPS and PGN increased osteogenic differentiation, but CpG-ODN decreased it. Poly(I:C) itself did not affect adipogenic or osteogenic differentiations, but exerted a synergistic effect on LPS- or PGN-induced osteogenic differentiation. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that LPS and PGN induce osteogenic markers in hADSCs. TLR agonists affected the expression of chemokines and cytokines differentially. Furthermore, hADSCs affected the expression of specific TLRs in vitro under hypoxic conditions. These data provide evidence of a nonimmune role for TLR signaling on MSCs and may provide clues to the behavior of transplanted MSCs in vivo.},

   Abstract = {In the absence of base-pairing and tertiary structure, ribonucleic acid (RNA) assumes a random-walk conformation, modulated by the electrostatic self-repulsion of the charged, flexible backbone. This behavior is often modeled as a Kratky-Porod "wormlike chain" (WLC) with a Barrat-Joanny scale-dependent persistence length. In this study we report measurements of the end-to-end extension of poly(U) RNA under 0.1 to 10 pN applied force and observe two distinct elastic-response regimes: a low-force, power-law regime characteristic of a chain of swollen blobs on long length scales and a high-force, salt-valence-dependent regime consistent with ion-stabilized crumpling on short length scales. This short-scale structure is additionally supported by force- and salt-dependent quantification of the RNA ion atmosphere composition, which shows that ions are liberated under stretching; the number of ions liberated increases with increasing bulk salt concentration. Both this result and the observation of two elastic-response regimes directly contradict the WLC model, which predicts a single elastic regime across all forces and, when accounting for scale-dependent persistence length, the opposite trend in ion release with salt concentration. We conclude that RNA is better described as a "snakelike chain," characterized by smooth bending on long length scales and ion-stabilized crumpling on short length scales. In monovalent salt, these two regimes are separated by a characteristic length that scales with the Debye screening length, highlighting the determining importance of electrostatics in RNA conformation.},

   Abstract = {Two classes of nucleic acids, bacterial DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs and dsRNA in viruses, induce the production of type I IFN that contributes to the immunostimulatory effects of these microbial molecules. Thus, it is important to determine which cells produce type I IFN in response to CpG DNA and dsRNA. CD4(+)CD11c(-) type 2 dendritic cell precursors (pre-DC2) were identified as the main producers of type I IFN in human blood in response to viruses. Here we asked whether pre-DC2 also produce type I IFN in response to CpG DNA and dsRNA. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing particular palindromic CpG motifs induced pre-DC2, but not CD11c(+) blood DC or monocytes, to produce IFN-alpha. In contrast, a synthetic dsRNA, polyinosinic polycytidylic-acid, induced CD11c(+) DC, but not pre-DC2 or monocytes, to produce IFN-alphabeta. These data indicate that CpG DNA and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stimulate different types of cells to produce type I IFN and that it is important to select oligodeoxynucleotides containing particular CpG motifs to induce pre-DC2 to produce type I IFN, which may play a key role in the strong adjuvant effects of CpG DNA.},

   Abstract = {Therapeutic cancer vaccines are designed to treat cancer by boosting the endogenous immune system to fight against the cancer. In the development of clinically effective cancer vaccines, one of the most practical objectives is to identify adjuvants that are capable of optimizing the vaccine effects. In this study, we explored the potential of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) and LAG-3-Ig (soluble recombinant protein of lymphocyte activation gene-3 [LAG-3] extracellular domain fused with human IgG Fc region) as adjuvants for P1A tumor antigen peptide vaccine in a pre-established P815 mouse tumor model with a transfer of tumor-specific T cells. Whereas the use of poly(I:C) or LAG-3-Ig as a signal adjuvant induced a slight enhancement of P1A vaccine effects compared to incomplete Freund's adjuvant, combined treatment with poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig remarkably potentiated antitumor effects, leading to complete rejection of pre-established tumor and long-term survival of mice. The potent adjuvant effects of poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig were associated with an enhanced infiltration of T cells in the tumor tissues, and an increased proliferation and Th1-type cytokine production of tumor-reactive T cells. Importantly, the combined adjuvant of poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig downregulated expressions of PD-1, LAG-3, and TIGIT on P1A-specific T cells, indicating prevention of T cell exhaustion. Taken together, the results of the current study show that the combined adjuvants of poly(I:C) plus LAG-3-Ig with tumor peptide vaccine induce profound antitumor effects by activating tumor-specific T cells.},

   Abstract = {Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) express functional membranous and cytoplasmic sensors for double-stranded (ds)RNA. Notably, FLS undergo apoptosis upon transfection with the synthetic dsRNA analog poly(I:C). We here studied the mechanism of intracellular poly(I:C) recognition and subsequent cell death in FLS. FLS responded similarly to poly(I:C) or 3pRNA transfection; however, only intracellular delivery of poly(I:C) induced significant cell death, accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins Puma and Noxa, caspase 3 cleavage, and nuclear segregation. Knockdown of the DExD/H-box helicase MDA5 did not affect the response to intracellular poly(I:C); in contrast, knockdown of RIG-I abrogated the response to 3pRNA. Knockdown of the downstream adaptor proteins IPS, STING, and TRIF or inhibition of TBK1 did not affect the response to intracellular poly(I:C), while knockdown of IFNAR blocked intracellular poly(I:C)-mediated signaling and cell death. We conclude that a so far unknown intracellular sensor recognizes linear dsRNA and induces apoptosis in FLS.},

Here, we report the use of poly(I:C) stabilized with chitosan as an adjuvant for development of better finfish vaccines. The adjuvant was co-injected with inactivated viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) (CSpIC+iV vaccine) in adult zebrafish and its efficiency in protection against VHSV infection was compared to a live, attenuated VHS virus vaccine (aV). Both free and stabilized poly(I:C) were strong inducers of an antiviral state, measured by transcriptional activation of the genes of viral sensors: toll-like receptors, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes, such as MXa within 48 h after injection. Both the CSpIC+iV and the aV formulations provided a significant protection against VHSV-induced mortality. However, when plasma from survivors was tested for neutralizing antibodies in an in vitro protection assay, we could not demonstrate any protective effect. On the contrary, plasma from aV vaccinated fish enhanced cytopathic effects, indicating that antibody-dependent entry may play a role in this system. Our results show that poly(I:C) is a promising candidate as an adjuvant for fish vaccination against viral pathogens, and that the zebrafish is a promising model for aquaculture-relevant vaccination studies.},

Although several nano-based vaccine formulations have been reported, to the best of our knowledge so far only one of them have been implemented in the industry. Here we report on chitosan-poly(I:C) nanoparticles (NPs) that could be used as a non-specific adjuvant in antiviral vaccines in aquaculture. We have characterized the physical parameters of the NPs, studied the in vivo and in vitro bio-distribution of fluorescent NPs and verified NP uptake by zebrafish leucocytes. We used the zebrafish model to test the protective efficiency of the recombinant glycoprotein G (rgpG) of VHSV compared to inactivated whole virus (iV) against VHSV using NPs as an adjuvant in both formulations. In parallel we tested free poly(I:C) and rgpG (pICrgpG), and free chitosan and rgpG (CSrgpG) vaccine formulations. While the iV group (with NP adjuvant) provided the highest overall survival, all vaccine formulations with poly(I:C) provided a significant protection against VHSV; possibly through an early induction of an anti-viral state. Our results suggest that chitosan-poly(I:C) NPs are a promising adjuvant candidate for future vaccine formulations.},

   Abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate expression of their target mRNAs through the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which contains an Argonaute (Ago) family protein as a core component. In Drosophila melanogaster, miRNAs are generally sorted into Ago1-containing RISC (Ago1-RISC). We established a native gel system that can biochemically dissect the Ago1-RISC assembly pathway. We found that miRNA-miRNA* duplexes are loaded into Ago1 as double-stranded RNAs in an ATP-dependent fashion. In contrast, unexpectedly, unwinding of miRNA-miRNA* duplexes is a passive process that does not require ATP or slicer activity of Ago1. Central mismatches direct miRNA-miRNA* duplexes into pre-Ago1-RISC, whereas mismatches in the seed or guide strand positions 12-15 promote conversion of pre-Ago1-RISC into mature Ago1-RISC. Our findings show that unwinding of miRNAs is a precise mirror-image process of target recognition, and both processes reflect the unique geometry of RNAs in Ago proteins.},

   Abstract = {Solvated metal ions are critical for the proper folding and function of RNA. Despite the importance of these ions, the details of specific metal ion-RNA interactions are poorly understood. The crystal structure of a group I intron ribozyme domain characterized several metal-binding sites in the RNA with osmium (III) hexammine bound in the major groove. A corresponding method for locating and characterizing metal-binding sites of RNA in solution is of obvious interest. NMR should be ideal for localizing metal hexammine ions bound to the RNA because of the large concentration of protons around the metal center.\\ We have solved the solution structure of the P5b stem loop from a group I intron ribozyme bound to a cobalt (III) hexammine ion. The location of the ion is precisely determined by intermolecular nuclear Overhausser effect cross-peaks between the cobalt (III) hexammine protons and both exchangeable and non-exchangeable RNA protons in the major groove. The binding site consists of tandem G-U base pairs in a sequence of four consecutive G residues ending in a GAAA tetraloop, as originally identified in the crystal structure. The edges of the bases in the major groove present an electrostatically negative face and a variety of hydrogen-bond acceptors for the cobalt (III) hexammine ion. The metal ion ligand is bound near the guanosine nucleotides of the adjacent G-U base pairs, where it makes hydrogen bonds with the N7 and carbonyl groups of both guanines. The carbonyl groups of the uracil residues add to the negative surface of the binding pocket, but do not form hydrogen bonds with the hexammine. Additional hydrogen bonds form with other guanine residues of the GGGG sequence. The structure of the binding site does not change significantly on binding the cobalt (III) hexammine. The structure of the complex in solution is very similar to the structure in the crystal.\\ The structure presents a picture of how tandem G-U base pairs bind and position metal ions within the RNA major groove. The binding site is performed in the absence of metal ions, and presents a negative pocket in the major groove with a variety of hydrogen-bond acceptors. Because G-U base pairs are such a common motif in RNA sequences, it is possible that this RNA-metal ion interaction is critical in forming large complex RNA structures such as those found in the ribosome and self-splicing introns. This structure was determined using cobalt (III) hexammine as an analog for hexahydrated magnesium, a technique that may be applicable to other RNA sequences. Metal hexammines may prove to be useful general probes for locating RNA metal ion binding sites in solution.},

   Abstract = {Respiratory viral infections cause significant morbidity and increase the risk for chronic pulmonary graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Our overall hypothesis is that local innate immune activation potentiates adaptive alloimmunity. In this study, we hypothesized that a viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) alone can potentiate pulmonary GVHD after allogeneic HCT. We, therefore, examined the effect of pulmonary exposure to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a viral mimetic that activates innate immunity, in an established murine HCT model. Poly I:C-induced a marked pulmonary T cell response in allogeneic HCT mice as compared to syngeneic HCT, with increased CD4+ cells in the lung fluid and tissue. This lymphocytic inflammation persisted at 2 weeks post poly I:C exposure in allogeneic mice and was associated with CD3+ cell infiltration into the bronchiolar epithelium and features of epithelial injury. In vitro, poly I:C enhanced allospecific proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. In vivo, poly I:C exposure was associated with an early increase in pulmonary monocyte recruitment and activation as well as a decrease in CD4+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in allogeneic mice as compared to syngeneic. In contrast, intrapulmonary poly I:C did not alter the extent of systemic GVHD in either syngeneic or allogeneic mice. Collectively, our results suggest that local activation of pulmonary innate immunity by a viral molecular pattern represents a novel pathway that contributes to pulmonary GVHD after allogeneic HCT, through a mechanism that includes increased recruitment and maturation of intrapulmonary monocytes.},

   Abstract = {The 1.7âÃÃ¢âÃ X-ray crystal structure of the B-DNA dodecamer, [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)]2 (DDD)-bound non-covalently to a platinum(II) complex, [{Pt(NH3)3}2-Â¬Âµ-{trans-Pt(NH3)2(NH2(CH2)6NH2)2}](NO3)6 (1, TriplatinNC-A,) shows the trinuclear cation extended along the phosphate backbone and bridging the minor groove. The square planar tetra-am(m)ine Pt(II) units form bidentate N-O-N complexes with OP atoms, in a Phosphate Clamp motif. The geometry is conserved and the interaction prefers O2P over O1P atoms (frequency of interaction is O2PâÃÃ¢>âÃÃ¢O1P, base and sugar oxygensâÃÃ¢>âÃÃ¢N). The binding mode is very similar to that reported for the DDD and [{trans-Pt(NH3)2(NH2(CH2)6(NH3+)}2-Â¬Âµ-{trans-Pt(NH3)2(NH2(CH2)6NH2)2}](NO3)8 (3, TriplatinNC), which exhibits in vivo anti-tumour activity. In the present case, only three sets of Phosphate Clamps were found because one of the three Pt(II) coordination spheres was not clearly observed and was characterized as a bare Pt2+ ion. Based on the electron density, the relative occupancy of DDD and the sum of three Pt(II) atoms in the DDD-1 complex was 1:1.69, whereas the ratio for DDD-2 was 1:2.85, almost the mixing ratio in the crystallization drop. The high repetition and geometric regularity of the motif suggests that it can be developed as a modular nucleic acid binding device with general utility.},

  abstract       = {The most dramatic example of RNA editing is found in the mitochondria of trypanosomes. In these organisms, U-insertions/deletions can create mRNAs that are twice as large as the gene that encodes them. Guide RNAs (gRNAs) that are complementary to short stretches of the mature message direct the precise placements of the U residues. The binding of gRNA to mRNA is a fundamental step in RNA editing and understanding the relative importance of the elements that confer affinity and specificity on this interaction is critical to our understanding of the editing process. In this study, we have analyzed the relative binding affinities of two different gRNA/mRNA pairs. The affinity of gA6-14 for its message (ATPase 6) is high, with an apparent K(D) in the 5-10 nM range. In contrast, gCYb-558 has a low affinity for its cognate mRNA. Deletion of the gRNA U-tail caused a significant reduction in the binding affinity for only the gCYb-558 pair, and was observed only under physiological magnesium conditions. These results indicate that the U-tail contribution can differ substantially between the different gRNA/mRNA pairs. In addition, our results suggest that the efficiency of gRNA/mRNA interaction is highly dependent on thermodynamic parameters determined by the local sequences and their adopted structures surrounding the anchor-binding site.},

   Abstract = {Mitochondrial mRNAs in Trypanosoma brucei undergo extensive insertion and deletion of uridylates that are catalyzed by the RNA editing core complex (RECC) and directed by hundreds of small guide RNAs (gRNAs) that base pair with mRNA. RECC is largely RNA-free, and accessory mitochondrial RNA-binding complex 1 (MRB1) variants serve as scaffolds for the assembly of mRNA-gRNA hybrids and RECC. However, the molecular steps that create higher-order holoenzymes ("editosomes") are unknown. Previously, we identified an RNA editing helicase 2-associated subcomplex (REH2C) and showed that REH2 binds RNA. Here we showed that REH2C is an mRNA-associated ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) subcomplex with editing substrates, intermediates, and products. We isolated this mRNP from mitochondria lacking gRNA-bound RNP (gRNP) subcomplexes and identified REH2-associated cofactors 1 and 2 ((H2)F1 and (H2)F2). (H2)F1 is an octa-zinc finger protein required for mRNP-gRNP docking, pre-mRNA and RECC loading, and RNP formation with a short synthetic RNA duplex. REH2 and other eukaryotic DEAH/RHA-type helicases share a conserved regulatory C-terminal domain cluster that includes an oligonucleotide-binding fold. Recombinant REH2 and (H2)F1 constructs associate in a purified complex in vitro. We propose a model of stepwise editosome assembly that entails controlled docking of mRNP and gRNP modules via specific base pairing between their respective mRNA and gRNA cargo and regulatory REH2 and (H2)F1 subunits of the novel mRNP that may control specificity checkpoints in the editing pathway.},

Is extensive RNA editing a primitive or derived character? We constructed a phylogenetic tree based on nuclear small-subunit and mitochondrial large- and small-subunit ribosomal RNA sequences for nine species of kinetoplastid protozoa. Our results suggest that extensive editing is a primitive genetic phenomenon that has disappeared in recent evolutionary time and also that there have been multiple losses of the digenetic lifestyle by loss of the vertebrate host in parasite evolution.},

   Abstract = {The immunostimulatory ability of synthetic oligonucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG-ODN), agonists of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), can be harnessed to promote antitumor immunity by their application at the tumor site to stimulate local activation of innate immunity; however, particularly in the lung, tumor-associated immunosuppression can subvert such antitumor innate immune responses. To locally maintain continuous activation of innate subpopulations while inhibiting immunosuppressive cells, we evaluated aerosol delivery CpG-ODN combined with Poly(I:C), a TLR3 agonist able to convert tumor-supporting macrophages to tumoricidal effectors, in the treatment of B16 melanoma lung metastases in C57BL/6 mice. Aerosolization of CpG-ODN with Poly(I:C) into the bronchoalveolar space reduced the presence of M2-associated arginase- and IL-10-secreting macrophages in tumor-bearing lungs and increased the antitumor activity of aerosolized CpG-ODN alone against B16 lung metastases without apparent signs of toxicity or injury of the bronchial-bronchiolar structures and alveolar walls. Moreover, CpG-ODN/Poly(I:C) aerosol combined with dacarbazine, a therapeutic agent used in patients with inoperable metastatic melanoma able to exert immunostimulatory effects, led to a significant increase in antitumor activity as compared to treatments with aerosolized CpG-ODN/Poly(I:C) or dacarbazine alone. This effect was related to an enhanced recruitment and cytotoxic activity of tumor-infiltrating NK cells in the lung. Our results point to aerosol delivery as a convenient approach for repeated applications of immunostimulants in patients with lung metastases to maintain a continuous local activation of innate immune cells while suppressing polarization of tumor-infiltrating macrophages to an M2 phenotype.},

Several model-preparation procedures are integrated in the molecular-replacement program MOLREP. These include model modification on the basis of amino-acid sequence alignment and model correction based on analysis of the solvent-accessibility of the atoms. The packing function used in MOLREP for the translational search is explained in the context of model preparation. In difficult cases, bioinformatics-based modifications are not sufficient for successful molecular replacement. An approach implemented in MOLREP for solving cases with translational noncrystallographic symmetry is an example of model preparation in which analysis of X-ray data plays an essential role. In addition, two examples are presented in which the X-ray data were used to refine partial models for subsequent use in molecular replacement.},

   Abstract = {Helices are an essential element in defining the three-dimensional architecture of structured RNAs. While internal basepairs in a canonical helix stack on both sides, the ends of the helix stack on only one side and are exposed to the loop side, thus susceptible to fraying unless they are protected. While coaxial stacking has long been known to stabilize helix ends by directly stacking two canonical helices coaxially, based on analysis of helix-loop junctions in RNA crystal structures, herein we describe helix capping, topological stacking of a helix end with a basepair or an unpaired nucleotide from the loop side, which in turn protects helix ends. Beyond the topological protection of helix ends against fraying, helix capping should confer greater stability onto the resulting composite helices. Our analysis also reveals that this general motif is associated with the formation of tertiary structure interactions. Greater knowledge about the dynamics at the helix-junctions in the secondary structure should enhance the prediction of RNA secondary structure with a richer set of energetic rules and help better understand the folding of a secondary structure into its three-dimensional structure. These together suggest that helix capping likely play a fundamental role in driving RNA folding.},

   Abstract = {A significant fraction of the bases in a folded, structured RNA molecule participate in noncanonical base pairing interactions, often in the context of internal loops or multi-helix junction loops. The appearance of each new high-resolution RNA structure provides welcome data to guide efforts to understand and predict RNA 3D structure, especially when the RNA in question is a functionally conserved molecule. The recent publication of the crystal structure of the "Loop E" region of bacterial 5S ribosomal RNA is such an event [Correll CC, Freeborn B, Moore PB, Steitz TA, 1997, Cell 91:705-712]. In addition to providing more examples of already established noncanonical base pairs, such as purine-purine sheared pairings, trans-Hoogsteen UA, and GU wobble pairs, the structure provides the first high-resolution views of two new purine-purine pairings and a new GU pairing. The goal of the present analysis is to expand the capabilities of both chemical probing and phylogenetic analysis to predict with greater accuracy the structures of RNA molecules. First, in light of existing chemical probing data, we investigate what lessons could be learned regarding the interpretation of this widely used method of RNA structure probing. Then we analyze the 3D structure with reference to molecular phylogeny data (assuming conservation of function) to discover what alternative base pairings are geometrically compatible with the structure. The comparisons between previous modeling efforts and crystal structures show that the intricate involvements of ions and water molecules in the maintenance of non-Watson-Crick pairs render the process of correctly identifying the interacting sites in such pairs treacherous, except in cases of trans-Hoogsteen A/U or sheared A/G pairs for the adenine N1 site. The phylogenetic analysis identifies A/A, A/C, A/U and C/A, C/C, and C/U pairings isosteric with sheared A/G, as well as A/A and A/C pairings isosteric with both G/U and G/G bifurcated pairings. Thus, each non-Watson-Crick pair could be characterized by a phylogenetic signature of variations between isosteric-like pairings. In addition to the conservative changes, which form a dictionary of pairings isosterically compatible with those observed in the crystal structure, concerted changes involving several base pairs also occur. The latter covariations may indicate transitions between related but distinctive motifs within the loop E of 5S ribosomal RNA.},

   Abstract = {Non-Watson-Crick base pairs mediate specific interactions responsible for RNA-RNA self-assembly and RNA-protein recognition. An unambiguous and descriptive nomenclature with well-defined and nonoverlapping parameters is needed to communicate concisely structural information about RNA base pairs. The definitions should reflect underlying molecular structures and interactions and, thus, facilitate automated annotation, classification, and comparison of new RNA structures. We propose a classification based on the observation that the planar edge-to-edge, hydrogen-bonding interactions between RNA bases involve one of three distinct edges: the Watson-Crick edge, the Hoogsteen edge, and the Sugar edge (which includes the 2'-OH and which has also been referred to as the Shallow-groove edge). Bases can interact in either of two orientations with respect to the glycosidic bonds, cis or trans relative to the hydrogen bonds. This gives rise to 12 basic geometric types with at least two H bonds connecting the bases. For each geometric type, the relative orientations of the strands can be easily deduced. High-resolution examples of 11 of the 12 geometries are presently available. Bifurcated pairs, in which a single exocyclic carbonyl or amino group of one base directly contacts the edge of a second base, and water-inserted pairs, in which single functional groups on each base interact directly, are intermediate between two of the standard geometries. The nomenclature facilitates the recognition of isosteric relationships among base pairs within each geometry, and thus facilitates the recognition of recurrent three-dimensional motifs from comparison of homologous sequences. Graphical conventions are proposed for displaying non-Watson-Crick interactions on a secondary structure diagram. The utility of the classification in homology modeling of RNA tertiary motifs is illustrated.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible gene I, and melanoma differentiation-associated antigen 5 (RIG-I/MDA-5) helicases are known to sense double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus and initiate antiviral responses, such as production of type-I interferons (IFNs). Recognition of dsRNA by TLR3 or RIG-I/MDA-5 is cell-type-dependent and recent studies have shown a direct link between TLRs and hematopoiesis. We hypothesized that viral dsRNA recognized by either TLR3 or RIG-I/MDA-5, affects the growth of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Here we show that polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-mediated very rapid apoptosis occurs within 1 hour in CD34(+) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid, another synthetic dsRNA that signals only through TLR3, had no effect. Poly I:C-LMW/LyoVec, a complex between low molecular-weight poly I:C and the transfection reagent LyoVec, which signals only through RIG-I/MDA-5, induces apoptosis of CD34(+) cells. A strong and sustained upregulation of messenger RNA and protein levels of Noxa, a proapoptotic BH3-only protein that can be induced by RIG-I/MDA-5 pathway, is found in CD34(+) cells treated by poly I:C. Although poly I:C upregulates type-I IFNs in CD34(+) cells, neither exogenous IFN-âÃ©Â¬Â± nor IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ induces rapid apoptosis in CD34(+) cells and neutralization or blocking of type-I IFN receptor does not rescue CD34(+) cells, whereas Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, rescues the cells from apoptosis. These results suggest that RIG-I/MDA-5, but not TLR3, signaling triggers poly I:C-induced rapid apoptosis of human CD34(+) cells, which will provide an insight into the mechanisms of dsRNA virus-mediated hematopoietic disorders.},

   Abstract = {We present a comprehensive software package, 3DNA, for the analysis, reconstruction and visualization of three-dimensional nucleic acid structures. Starting from a coordinate file in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format, 3DNA can handle antiparallel and parallel double helices, single-stranded structures, triplexes, quadruplexes and other complex tertiary folding motifs found in both DNA and RNA structures. The analysis routines identify and categorize all base interactions and classify the double helical character of appropriate base pair steps. The program makes use of a recently recommended reference frame for the description of nucleic acid base pair geometry and a rigorous matrix-based scheme to calculate local conformational parameters and rebuild the structure from these parameters. The rebuilding routines produce rectangular block representations of nucleic acids as well as full atomic models with the sugar-phosphate backbone and publication quality 'standardized' base stacking diagrams. Utilities are provided to locate the base pairs and helical regions in a structure and to reorient structures for effective visualization. Regular helical models based on X-ray diffraction measurements of various repeating sequences can also be generated within the program.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Rapid and robust induction of type I IFN (IFN-I) is a critical event in host antiviral innate immune response. It has been well demonstrated that cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) plays an important role in sensing cytosolic DNA and triggering STING dependent signaling to induce IFN-I. However, it is largely unknown how cGAS itself is regulated during pathogen infection and IFN-I production. In this study, we show that pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands, including lipid A, LPS, poly(I:C), poly(dA:dT), and cGAMP, induce cGAS expression in an IFN-I-dependent manner in both mouse and human macrophages. Further experiments indicated that cGAS is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG), and two adjacent IFN-sensitive response elements (ISREs) in the promoter region of cGAS mediate the induction of cGAS by IFN-I. Additionally, we show that optimal production of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ triggered by poly (dA:dT) or HSV-1 requires IFNAR signaling. Knockdown of the constitutively expressed DNA sensor DDX41 attenuates poly(dA:dT)-triggered IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ production and cGAS induction. By analyzing the dynamic expression of poly(dA:dT)-induced IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ and cGAS transcripts, we have found that induction of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ is earlier than cGAS. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that induction of cGAS by IFN-I meditates the subsequent positive feedback regulation of DNA-triggered IFN-I production. Thus, our study not only provides a novel mechanism of modulating cGAS expression, but also adds another layer of regulation in DNA-triggered IFN-I production by induction of cGAS.},

   Abstract = {Mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastids require extensive U-insertion/deletion editing that progresses 3'-to-5' in small blocks, each directed by a guide RNA (gRNA), and exhibits substrate and developmental stage-specificity by unsolved mechanisms. Here, we address compositionally related factors, collectively known as the mitochondrial RNA-binding complex 1 (MRB1) or gRNA-binding complex (GRBC), that contain gRNA, have a dynamic protein composition, and transiently associate with several mitochondrial factors including RNA editing core complexes (RECC) and ribosomes. MRB1 controls editing by still unknown mechanisms. We performed the first next-generation sequencing study of native subcomplexes of MRB1, immunoselected via either RNA helicase 2 (REH2), that binds RNA and associates with unwinding activity, or MRB3010, that affects an early editing step. The particles contain either REH2 or MRB3010 but share the core GAP1 and other proteins detected by RNA photo-crosslinking. Analyses of the first editing blocks indicate an enrichment of several initiating gRNAs in the MRB3010-purified complex. Our data also indicate fast evolution of mRNA 3' ends and strain-specific alternative 3' editing within 3' UTR or C-terminal protein-coding sequence that could impact mitochondrial physiology. Moreover, we found robust specific copurification of edited and pre-edited mRNAs, suggesting that these particles may bind both mRNA and gRNA editing substrates. We propose that multiple subcomplexes of MRB1 with different RNA/protein composition serve as a scaffold for specific assembly of editing substrates and RECC, thereby forming the editing holoenzyme. The MRB3010-subcomplex may promote early editing through its preferential recruitment of initiating gRNAs.},

   Abstract = {Adaptation and survival of Trypanosoma brucei requires editing of mitochondrial mRNA by uridylate (U) insertion and deletion. Hundreds of small guide RNAs (gRNAs) direct the mRNA editing at over 3,000 sites. RNA editing is controlled during the life cycle but the regulation of substrate and stage specificity remains unknown. Editing progresses in the 3' to 5' direction along the pre-mRNA in blocks, each targeted by a unique gRNA. A critical editing factor is the mitochondrial RNA binding complex 1 (MRB1) that binds gRNA and transiently interacts with the catalytic RNA editing core complex (RECC). MRB1 is a large and dynamic complex that appears to be comprised of distinct but related subcomplexes (termed here MRBs). MRBs seem to share a 'core' complex of proteins but differ in the composition of the 'variable' proteins. Since some proteins associate transiently the MRBs remain imprecisely defined. MRB1 controls editing by unknown mechanisms, and the functional relevance of the different MRBs is unclear. We previously identified two distinct MRBs, and showed that they carry mRNAs that undergo editing. We proposed that editing takes place in the MRBs because MRBs stably associate with mRNA and gRNA but only transiently interact with RECC, which is RNA free. Here, we identify the first specialized functions in MRBs: 1) 3010-MRB is a major scaffold for RNA editing, and 2) REH2-MRB contains a critical trans-acting RNA helicase (REH2) that affects multiple steps of editing function in 3010-MRB. These trans effects of the REH2 include loading of unedited mRNA and editing in the first block and in subsequent blocks as editing progresses. REH2 binds its own MRB via RNA, and conserved domains in REH2 were critical for REH2 to associate with the RNA and protein components of its MRB. Importantly, REH2 associates with a ~30 kDa RNA-binding protein in a novel ~15S subcomplex in RNA-depleted mitochondria. We use these new results to update our model of MRB function and organization.},

   Abstract = {Pyrimidine oligonucleotides recognize extended purine sequences in the major groove of double-helical DNA by triple-helix formation. The resulting local triple helices are relatively stable and can block DNA recognition by sequence-specific DNA binding proteins such as restriction endonucleases. Association and dissociation kinetics for the oligodeoxyribonucleotide 5'-CTCTTTCCTCTCTTTTTCCCC (bold C's indicate 5-methylcytosine residues) are now measured with a restriction endonuclease protection assay. When oligonucleotides are present in greater than 10-fold excess over the DNA target site, the binding reaction kinetics are pseudo first order in oligonucleotide concentration. Under our standard conditions (37 degrees C, 25 mM Tris-acetate, pH 6.8, 70 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM magnesium chloride, 0.4 mM spermine tetrahydrochloride, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin) the value of the observed pseudo-first-order association rate constant, k2obs, is 1.8 x 10(3) +/- 1.9 x 10(2) L.(mol of oligomer-1.s-1. Measurement of the dissociation rate constant yields an equilibrium dissociation constant of approximately 10 nM. Increasing sodium ion concentration slightly decreased the association rate, substantially increased the dissociation rate, and thereby reduced the equilibrium binding constant. This effect was reversible by increasing multivalent cation concentration, confirming the significant role of multivalent cations in oligonucleotide-directed triple-helix formation under these conditions. Finally, a small reduction in association rate, a large increase in dissociation rate, and a resulting reduction in the equilibrium binding constant were observed upon increasing the pH between 6.8 and 7.2.},

We investigated the effects of double-stranded (ds) RNA on interferon (IFN)-beta and chemokine (CK) expression in these cells. By microarray and ELISA, we showed strong induction of CXCL10 and interleulin (IL)-8 besides IFN-beta and other CK ligands. RNA interference directed silencing of TLR3, RIG-I, IRF3, NFkappaB or MAP kinases (p38, ERK, JNK) was carried out. Knockdown of all these molecules, except ERK and JNK, blocked IFN-beta production. Both TLR3 and RIG-I are required for CXCL10 expression. Silencing of TLR3 completely impaired the IL-8 expression. dsRNA-conditioned medium from HepaRG cells exerted a drastic antiviral effect in HCV replicons, and in the JFH-1-based HCV production cell culture system. The IFN-beta knockdown in HepaRG cells removed this antiviral effect but did not enhance their capacity to initiate HCV RNA replication. We conclude that dsRNA induces antiviral and pro-inflammatory status in HepaRG cells.},

   Abstract = {The immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) make them an attractive therapeutic tool to treat chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. These indications are characterized by a chronic activation of immune cells that perpetuates the disease. In vitro, when adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) are cultured with T lymphocytes at the time of stimulation, their proliferation is inhibited. However, these experimental settings do not necessarily fit with what ASCs will face in inflammatory conditions in vivo, where ASCs will likely encounter and interact with already activated immune cells which might affect their immunomodulatory capacity. In most in vitro studies, MSCs have been cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells at the time of lymphocyte stimulation and information about the interaction between MSCs and prestimulated lymphocytes in vitro is scarce. Therefore, a better understanding of the capacity of MSCs to modulate the responses of preactivated immune cells is needed. In this study we focused on the effects of ASCs on prestimulated lymphocytes and systematically investigated the potential mechanisms involved. We report that prestimulation of T lymphocytes 48 h before the coculture with ASCs impairs the capacity of ASCs to inhibit proliferation. Preactivation of ASCs with interferon âÃ©Â¬â¥ or the toll-like receptor ligand Poly I:C, but not other stimuli tested, enhanced the ability to inhibit the proliferation of 48 h-stimulated T lymphocytes. The inhibitory effect of ASCs was shown to be time dependent and mediated through the actual magnitude of tryptophan degradation by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.},

   Abstract = {Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation on microglia and astrocytes are key elements in neuroinflammation which accompanies a number of neurological disorders. While TLR activation on glia is well-established to up-regulate pro-inflammatory mediator expression, much less is known about how ligand engagement of one TLR may affect expression of other TLRs on microglia and astrocytes.\\ In the present study, we evaluated the effects of agonists for TLR2 (zymosan), TLR3 (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analogue of double-stranded RNA) and TLR4 (lipopolysaccaride (LPS)) in influencing expression of their cognate receptor as well as that of the other TLRs in cultures of rat cortical purified microglia (>99.5 %) and nominally microglia-free astrocytes. Elimination of residual microglia (a common contaminant of astrocyte cultures) was achieved by incubation with the lysosomotropic agent L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (L-LME).\\ Flow cytometric analysis confirmed the purity (essentially 100 %) of the obtained microglia, and up to 5 % microglia contamination of astrocytes. L-LME treatment effectively removed microglia from the latter (real-time polymerase chain reaction). The three TLR ligands robustly up-regulated gene expression for pro-inflammatory markers (interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor) in microglia and enriched, but not purified, astrocytes, confirming cellular functionality. LPS, zymosan and poly(I:C) all down-regulated TLR4 messenger RNA (mRNA) and up-regulated TLR2 mRNA at 6 and 24 h. In spite of their inability to elaborate pro-inflammatory mediator output, the nominally microglia-free astrocytes (>99 % purity) also showed similar behaviours to those of microglia, as well as changes in TLR3 gene expression. LPS interaction with TLR4 activates downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B signalling pathways and subsequently causes inflammatory mediator production. The effects of LPS on TLR2 mRNA in both cell populations were antagonized by a nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B inhibitor.\\ TLR2 and TLR4 activation in particular, in concert with microglia and astrocytes, comprise key elements in the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The finding that both homologous (zymosan) and heterologous (LPS, poly(I:C)) TLR ligands are capable of regulating TLR2 gene expression, in particular, may have important implications in understanding the relative contributions of different TLRs in neurological disorders associated with neuroinflammation.},

   Abstract = {Viral diseases are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in oysters, resulting in significant economic losses. We investigated the proteomic responses of these two species of oysters to generic double-stranded RNAs (poly I:C and poly A:U). Analysis of proteomic data using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitaion (iTRAQ) indicated that there were significant differences in the proteomic responses of the two oyster species resulting from this treatment. Gene ontology analysis showed that several biological processes, cellular components, and molecular function were unique to the different data sets. For example, a number of proteins implicated in the TLR signaling pathway were associated with the Saccostrea glomerata data set but were absent in the Crassostra gigas data set. These results suggest that the differences in the proteomic responses to dsRNA may underpin the biological differences in viral susceptibility. Molecular targets previously shown to be expressed in C. gigas in response to OsHV1 infections were not present in our proteomic data sets, although they were present in the RNA extracted from the very same tissues. Taken together, our data indicate that there are substantial disparities between transcriptomic and proteomic responses to dsRNA challenge, and a comprehensive account of the oysters' biological responses to these treatments must take into account that disparity.},

   Abstract = {Chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are common respiratory disorders worldwide. Exacerbations of these diseases are frequent and worsen patients' respiratory condition and overall health. However, the mechanisms of exacerbation have not been fully elucidated. Recently, it was reported that interleukin (IL)-17A might play an important role in neutrophilic inflammation, which is characteristic of such exacerbations, through increased production of neutrophil chemoattractants. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-17A was involved in the pathogenesis of acute exacerbation, due to viral infection in chronic inflammatory airway diseases. In this study, we assessed chemokine production by bronchial epithelial cells and investigated the underlying mechanisms. Comprehensive chemokine analysis showed that, compared with poly(I:C) alone, co-stimulation of BEAS-2B cells with IL-17A and poly(I:C) strongly induced production of such neutrophil chemoattractants as CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL)8, growth-related oncogene (GRO), and CXCL1. Co-stimulation synergistically induced CXCL8 and CXCL1 mRNA and protein production by BEAS-2B cells and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. Poly(I:C) induced chemokine expression by BEAS-2B cells mainly via Toll-like receptor 3/TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-âÃ©Â¬â¤-mediated signals. The co-stimulation with IL-17A and poly(I:C) markedly activated the p38 and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway, compared with poly(I:C), although there was little change in nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B translocation into the nucleus or the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor-âÃ©Â¬â«B and activator protein 1. IL-17A promoted stabilization of CXCL8 mRNA in BEAS-2B cells treated with poly(I:C). In conclusion, IL-17A appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory airway disease exacerbation, due to viral infection by promoting release of neutrophil chemoattractants from bronchial epithelial cells.},

  abstract       = {For the successful X-ray structure determination of macromolecules, it is first necessary to identify, usually by matrix screening, conditions that yield some sort of crystals. Initial crystals are frequently microcrystals or clusters, and often have unfavorable morphologies or yield poor diffraction intensities. It is therefore generally necessary to improve upon these initial conditions in order to obtain better crystals of sufficient quality for X-ray data collection. Even when the initial samples are suitable, often marginally, refinement of conditions is recommended in order to obtain the highest quality crystals that can be grown. The quality of an X-ray structure determination is directly correlated with the size and the perfection of the crystalline samples; thus, refinement of conditions should always be a primary component of crystal growth. The improvement process is referred to as optimization, and it entails sequential, incremental changes in the chemical parameters that influence crystallization, such as pH, ionic strength and precipitant concentration, as well as physical parameters such as temperature, sample volume and overall methodology. It also includes the application of some unique procedures and approaches, and the addition of novel components such as detergents, ligands or other small molecules that may enhance nucleation or crystal development. Here, an attempt is made to provide guidance on how optimization might best be applied to crystal-growth problems, and what parameters and factors might most profitably be explored to accelerate and achieve success.},

   Abstract = {We present a comprehensive structural, evolutionary and molecular dynamics (MD) study of the G/U wobble basepairs in the ribosome based on high-resolution crystal structures, including the recent Escherichia coli structure. These basepairs are classified according to their tertiary interactions, and sequence conservation at their positions is determined. G/U basepairs participating in tertiary interactions are more conserved than those lacking any interactions. Specific interactions occurring in the G/U shallow groove pocket--like packing interactions (P-interactions) and some phosphate backbone interactions (phosphate-in-pocket interactions)--lead to higher G/U conservation than others. Two salient cases of unique phylogenetic compensation are discovered. First, a P-interaction is conserved through a series of compensatory mutations involving all four participating nucleotides to preserve or restore the G/U in the optimal orientation. Second, a G/U basepair forming a P-interaction and another one forming a phosphate-in-pocket interaction are replaced by GNRA loops that maintain similar tertiary contacts. MD simulations were carried out on eight P-interactions. The specific GU/CG signature of this interaction observed in structure and sequence analysis was rationalized, and can now be used for improving sequence alignments.},

These symmetrical RNA molecules are more likely to crystallize without end-on-end statistical packing disorder because the two halves of the molecule are identical. This approach can be used to study many fragments of double-stranded RNA or many isolated helical domains from large single-stranded RNAs that may not yet be amenable to high-resolution studies by crystallography or NMR. We used fusion RNAs to study one (the U-helix) of three functional domains formed when guide RNA binds to its cognate pre-edited mRNA from the trypanosome RNA editing system. The U-helix forms when the 3' oligo(U) tail of the guide RNA (gRNA) binds to the purine-rich, pre-edited mRNA upstream from the current RNA editing site. Fusion RNAs 16-and 32-base pairs in length formed crystals that gave diffraction to 1.37 and 1.05 âÃ respectively. We provide the composition of a fusion RNA crystallization screen and describe the X-ray data collection, structure determination, and refinement of the crystal structures of fusion RNAs.},

The almost three helical turns of the RNA in the asymmetric unit introduced partial or imperfect translational pseudosymmetry (TPS) that modulated the intensities when averaged by the l Miller indices but still escaped automated detection. Almost six times as many random phase sets had to be tested on average to reach a correct structure compared with a similar-sized RNA hairpin (27 nucleotides, 580 non-H RNA atoms) without TPS.

   Abstract = {To try to resolve the loss of stability in the temperature-sensitive mutant of T4 lysozyme, Arg 96 --> His, all of the remaining 18 naturally occurring amino acids were substituted at site 96. Also, in response to suggestions that the charged residues Lys85 and Asp89, which are 5-8 A away, may have important effects, each of these amino acids was replaced with alanine. Crystal structures were determined for many of the variants. With the exception of the tryptophan and valine mutants R96W and R96V, the crystallographic analysis shows that the substituted side chain following the path of Arg96 in wildtype (WT). The melting temperatures of the variants decrease by up to approximately 16 degrees C with WT being most stable. There are two site 96 replacements, with lysine or glutamine, that leave the stability close to that of WT. The only element that the side chains of these residues have in common with the WT arginine is the set of three carbon atoms at the C(alpha), C(beta), and C(gamma) positions. Although each side chain is long and flexible with a polar group at the distal position, the details of the hydrogen bonding to the rest of the protein differ in each case. Also, the glutamine replacement lacks a positive charge. This shows that there is some adaptability in achieving full stabilization at this site. At the other extreme, to be maximally destabilizing a mutation at site 96 must not only eliminate favorable interactions but also introduce an unfavorable element such as steric strain or a hydrogen-bonding group that remains unsatisfied. Overall, the study highlights the essential need for atomic resolution site-specific structural information to understand and to predict the stability of mutant proteins. It can be very misleading to simply assume that conservative amino acid substitutions cause small changes in stability, whereas large stability changes are associated with nonconservative replacements.},

A variant with seven substitutions ("Core-7") was identified as having the most favorable energy. The redesign experiment was repeated with a penalty for the presence of methionine residues. In this case the redesigned protein ("Core-10") had ten amino acid changes. The two designed proteins, as well as the constituent single mutants, and several single-site revertants were over-expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subjected to crystallographic and thermal analyses. The thermodynamic and structural data show that some repacking was achieved although neither redesigned protein was more stable than the wild-type protein. The use of the methionine penalty was shown to be effective. Several of the side-chain rotamers in the predicted structure of Core-10 differ from those observed. Rather than changing to new rotamers predicted by the design process, side-chains tend to maintain conformations similar to those seen in the native molecule. In contrast, parts of the backbone change by up to 2.8A relative to both the designed structure and wild-type. Water molecules that are present within the lysozyme molecule were removed during the design process. In the redesigned protein the resultant cavities were, to some degree, re-occupied by side-chain atoms. In the observed structure, however, water molecules were still bound at or near their original sites. This suggests that it may be preferable to leave such water molecules in place during the design procedure. The results emphasize the specificity of the packing that occurs within the core of a typical protein. While point substitutions within the core are tolerated they almost always result in a loss of stability. Likewise, combinations of substitutions may also be tolerated but usually destabilize the protein. Experience with T4 lysozyme suggests that a general core repacking methodology with retention or enhancement of stability may be difficult to achieve without provision for shifts in the backbone.},

   Abstract = {We have solved the structures of the homoduplex d(Gm5CGCGCG)2, and the heteroduplexes d(GCGCGCG)/d(TCGCGCG) and d(GCGCGCG)/d(CCGCGCG). The structures form six base-pairs of identical Z-DNA duplexes with single nucleotides overhanging at the 5'-ends. The overhanging nucleotide from one strand remains stacked and sandwiched between the blunt-ends of two adjacent Z-DNA duplexes, while the overhanging base of the opposing strand is extra-helical. The stacked and the extra-helical bases from adjacent duplexes pair to form a distorted d(G x G) reverse Hoogsteen base-pair in the d(Gm5CGCGCG)2 homoduplex, and d(G x T) reverse wobble and d(G x C) reverse Watson-Crick base-pairs in the d(GCGCGCG)/d(TCGCGCG) and d(GCGCGCG)/d(CCGCGCG) heteroduplexes, respectively. Interestingly, only the d(G,T) and d(G x C) base-pairs were observed in the heteroduplexes, suggesting that both the d(G x T) reverse wobble and d(G x C) reverse Watson-Crick base-pairs are more stable in this crystal environment than the d(G x G) reverse Hoogsteen base-pair. To estimate the relative stability of the three types of reverse base-pairs, crystals were grown using various mixtures of sequences and their strand compositions analyzed by mass spectrometry. The d(G x C) reverse Watson-Crick base-pair was estimated to be more stable by approximately 1.5 kcal/mol and the d(G x T) reverse wobble base-pair more stable by approximately 0.5 kcal/mol than the d(G x G) reverse Hoogsteen base-pair. The step during crystallization responsible for discriminating between the strands in the crystal is highly cooperative, suggesting that it occurs during the initial nucleating event of crystal growth.},

   Abstract = {Myotonic dystrophy (DM) type 1 is associated with an expansion of (>50) CTG repeats within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the dystrophin myotonin protein kinase gene (dmpk). In the corresponding mRNA transcript, the CUG repeats form an extended stem-loop structure. The double-stranded RNA of the stem sequesters RNA binding proteins away from their normal cellular targets resulting in aberrant transcription, alternative splicing patterns, or both, thereby leading to DM. To better understand the structural basis of DM type 1, we determined to 1.58-A resolution the x-ray crystal structure of an 18-bp RNA containing six CUG repeats. The CUG repeats form antiparallel double-stranded helices that stack end-on-end in the crystal to form infinite, pseudocontinuous helices similar to the long CUG stem loops formed by the expanded CUG repeats in DM type 1. The CUG helix is very similar in structure to A-form RNA with the exception of the unique U-U mismatches. This structure provides a high-resolution view of a toxic, trinucleotide repeat RNA.},

  abstract       = {Proteins with more than 1000 non-H atoms and without heavy-atom prosthetic groups are very difficult to solve by ab initio direct methods. T4 lysozyme is being used to explore these limits. The protein has 1309 non-H atoms, seven S atoms, no disulfide bonds and no heavy-atom prosthetic group. It is recalcitrant to structure determination by direct methods using X-ray diffraction data to 0.97 A. It is shown here that it is possible to obtain a truly ab initio structure determination of a variant of the protein that has an Rb+ (Z = 37) binding site. Using diffraction data to 1.06 A resolution, the direct-methods programs SIR2002 and ACORN independently solved the structure in about 20 h. The bound Rb+, which contributes about 1.7% of the total scattering, does not appear to distort the structure or to inhibit refinement (R factor 12.1%). The phases obtained via SIR2002 or ACORN are in good agreement with those from a reference structure obtained from conventional molecular-substitution and refinement procedures (average error in the figure-of-merit-weighted phases of less than 25 degrees). Thus, proteins with more than 1000 atoms that include halide-binding or other such sites may be amenable to structure determination by ab initio direct methods. The direct-methods approaches are also compared with structure determination via use of the anomalous scattering of the Rb+ ion. As shown by examples, high-resolution structures determined by direct methods can be useful in highlighting regions of strain in the protein, including short hydrogen bonds and non-planar peptide groups.},

   Abstract = {The X-ray crystal structure of the previously unknown bacteriophage P22 lysozyme, the product of gene 19, has been determined ab initio by direct methods using the program SIR2002. The presence of several partially occupied iodine anions and samarium cations augmented the ability of direct methods to locate all 2268 non-H protein atoms in the asymmetric unit, making this one of the largest structures to date to be determined ab initio. The iodides were introduced from a quick soak, which the crystal survived sufficiently well to diffract to 1.04 angstroms resolution. The complete heavy-atom substructure contributed 6.6% of the total scattering power. The initial determination of the structure assumed that there were two iodide ions in the asymmetric unit, although it was later determined that these sites correspond to partially occupied samarium ions. Tests suggested that it is better to overestimate rather than underestimate the heavy-atom content. While experimental phases from all of the successful tests were of high quality, the best results came from a SAD experiment using the programs SHELXD and SHELXE. Nonetheless, ab initio structure determination by direct methods was found to be a viable alternative to traditional protein crystallographic methods provided that the X-ray data extend to atomic resolution and heavy atoms with sufficient scattering power are present in the crystal.},

   Abstract = {We have solved the single-crystal X-ray structures of two different hexanucleotides: the alternating sequence d(Gm5CGm5CGC), and the non-alternating sequence d(Gm5CCGGC). Both of these hexamers crystallize readily as A-DNA in the orthorhombic space group C222(1). Although hexanucleotides have been previously crystallized as Z-DNA, and in one case as B-DNA, this is the first time hexanucleotides have been crystallized as A-DNA. Both hexamers adopt a typical A-conformation, which is surprisingly more similar to the structure of A-DNA fibers than to other A-DNA single crystals. The structure of d(Gm5CGm5CGC) was solved to a resolution of 2.1 A (R-factor = 19.6%). This structure has all of the features characteristic of canonical A-DNA, including it's helical repeat (11.2 bp/turn), helical rise (2.6 A/bp), base-pair displacement (-4.7 A), base inclination angle (16.9 degrees), and sugar puckers that are predominantly 3'-endo. The lower resolution, non-alternating structure has similar overall average values for these parameters. We observed several sequence-dependent correlations in these parameters, especially in the d(CG) base step. These steps have lower twist and rise values, coupled with high roll angles as compared to d(GC) steps. The molecular interactions involved in crystal packing and the detailed structure of the bound water in the crystals, however, are similar to those of longer 8 and 10 bp A-DNA crystal structures. Although the structural effect of cytosine methylation on A-DNA appears to be minimal, this modification significantly affects the ability of these sequences to crystallize as A-DNA. In conclusion, we present the A-DNA forming class of hexanucleotides, a new crystallographic system for studying DNA structure at near atomic resolution.},

   Abstract = {Proteins of the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-containing family recently gained attention as important components of the innate immune system. Although over 20 of these proteins are present in humans, only a few members including the cytosolic pattern recognition receptors NOD1, NOD2, and NLRP3 have been analyzed extensively. These NLRs were shown to be pivotal for mounting innate immune response toward microbial invasion. Here we report on the characterization of human NLRC5 and provide evidence that this NLR has a function in innate immune responses. We found that NLRC5 is a cytosolic protein expressed predominantly in hematopoetic cells. NLRC5 mRNA and protein expression was inducible by the double-stranded RNA analog poly(I.C) and Sendai virus. Overexpression of NLRC5 failed to trigger inflammatory responses such as the NF-kappaB or interferon pathways in HEK293T cells. However, knockdown of endogenous NLRC5 reduced Sendai virus- and poly(I.C)-mediated type I interferon pathway-dependent responses in THP-1 cells and human primary dermal fibroblasts. Taken together, this defines a function for NLRC5 in anti-viral innate immune responses.},

   Abstract = {We have applied tethered particle microscopy (TPM) as a single molecule analysis tool to studies of the conformational dynamics of poly-uridine(U) messenger (m)RNA and 16S ribosomal (r)RNA molecules. Using stroboscopic total internal reflection illumination and rigorous selection criteria to distinguish from nonspecific tethering, we have tracked the nanometer-scale Brownian motion of RNA-tethered fluorescent microspheres in all three dimensions at pH 7.5, 22 degrees C, in 10 mM or 100 mM NaCl in the absence or presence of 10 mM MgCl(2). The addition of Mg(2+) to low-ionic strength buffer results in significant compaction and stiffening of poly(U) mRNA, but not of 16S rRNA. Furthermore, the motion of poly(U)-tethered microspheres is more heterogeneous than that of 16S rRNA-tethered microspheres. Analysis of in-plane bead motion suggests that poly(U) RNA, but less so 16S rRNA, can be modeled both in the presence and absence of Mg(2+) by a statistical Gaussian polymer model. We attribute these differences to the Mg(2+)-induced compaction of the relatively weakly structured and structurally disperse poly(U) mRNA, in contrast to Mg(2+)-induced reinforcement of existing secondary and tertiary structure contacts in the highly structured 16S rRNA. Both effects are nonspecific, however, as they are dampened in the presence of higher concentrations of monovalent cations.},

As double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) are conserved molecular patterns associated with virus replication, we applied dsRNAs or synthetic dsRNA analogs to Arabidopsis thaliana and investigated PTI responses. We show that in vitro-generated dsRNAs, dsRNAs purified from virus-infected plants and the dsRNA analog polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) induce typical PTI responses dependent on the co-receptor SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1 (SERK1), but independent of dicer-like (DCL) proteins in Arabidopsis. Moreover, dsRNA treatment of Arabidopsis induces SERK1-dependent antiviral resistance. Screening of Arabidopsis wild accessions demonstrates natural variability in dsRNA sensitivity. Our findings suggest that dsRNAs represent genuine PAMPs in plants, which induce a signaling cascade involving SERK1 and a specific dsRNA receptor. The dependence of dsRNA-mediated PTI on SERK1, but not on DCLs, implies that dsRNA-mediated PTI involves membrane-associated processes and operates independently of RNA silencing. dsRNA sensitivity may represent a useful trait to increase antiviral resistance in cultivated plants.},

   Abstract = {The deformability of double helical DNA is critical for its packaging in the cell, recognition by other molecules, and transient opening during biochemically important processes. Here, a complete set of sequence-dependent empirical energy functions suitable for describing such behavior is extracted from the fluctuations and correlations of structural parameters in DNA-protein crystal complexes. These elastic functions provide useful stereochemical measures of the local base step movements operative in sequence-specific recognition and protein-induced deformations. In particular, the pyrimidine-purine dimers stand out as the most variable steps in the DNA-protein complexes, apparently acting as flexible "hinges" fitting the duplex to the protein surface. In addition to the angular parameters widely used to describe DNA deformations (i.e., the bend and twist angles), the translational parameters describing the displacements of base pairs along and across the helical axis are analyzed. The observed correlations of base pair bending and shearing motions are important for nonplanar folding of DNA in nucleosomes and other nucleoprotein complexes. The knowledge-based energies also offer realistic three-dimensional models for the study of long DNA polymers at the global level, incorporating structural features beyond the scope of conventional elastic rod treatments and adding a new dimension to literal analyses of genomic sequences.},

   Shorttitle = {Protein-DNA recognition},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Several general principles emerge from the studies of Cro, lambda repressor, and CAP. The DNA-binding sites are recognized in a form similar to B-DNA. They do not form cruciforms or other novel DNA structures. There seem to be proteins that bind left-handed Z-DNA (87) and DNA in other conformations, but it remains to be seen how these structures are recognized or how proteins recognize specific sequences in single-stranded DNA. Cro, repressor, and CAP use symmetrically related subunits to interact with two-fold related sites in the operator sequences. Many other DNA-binding proteins are dimers or tetramers and their operator sequences have approximate two-fold symmetry. It seems likely that these proteins will, like Cro, repressor, and CAP, form symmetric complexes. However, there is no requirement for symmetry in protein-DNA interactions. Some sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, like RNA polymerase, do not have symmetrically related subunits and do not bind to symmetric recognition sequences. Cro, repressor, and CAP use alpha-helices for many of the contacts between side chains and bases in the major groove. An adjacent alpha-helical region contacts the DNA backbone and may help to orient the "recognition" helices. This use of alpha-helical regions for DNA binding appears to be a common mode of recognition. Most of the contacts made by Cro, repressor, and CAP occur on one side of the double helix. However, lambda repressor contacts both sides of the double helix by using a flexible region of protein to wrap around the DNA. Recognition of specific base sequences involves hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between side chains and the edges of base pairs. These specific interactions, together with backbone interactions and electrostatic interactions, stabilize the protein-DNA complexes. The current models for the complexes of Cro, repressor, and CAP with operator DNA are probably fundamentally correct, but it should be emphasized that model building alone, even when coupled with genetic and biochemical studies, cannot be expected to provide a completely reliable "high-resolution" view of the protein-DNA complex. For example, the use of standard B-DNA geometry for the operator is clearly an approximation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

   Abstract = {The classical RNA secondary structure model considers A.U and G.C Watson-Crick as well as G.U wobble base pairs. Here we substitute it for a new one, in which sets of nucleotide cyclic motifs define RNA structures. This model allows us to unify all base pairing energetic contributions in an effective scoring function to tackle the problem of RNA folding. We show how pipelining two computer algorithms based on nucleotide cyclic motifs, MC-Fold and MC-Sym, reproduces a series of experimentally determined RNA three-dimensional structures from the sequence. This demonstrates how crucial the consideration of all base-pairing interactions is in filling the gap between sequence and structure. We use the pipeline to define rules of precursor microRNA folding in double helices, despite the presence of a number of presumed mismatches and bulges, and to propose a new model of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 -1 frame-shifting element.},

   Abstract = {Maternal immune activation (MIA) resulting from prenatal exposure to infectious pathogens or inflammatory stimuli is increasingly recognized to play an important etiological role in neuropsychiatric disorders with neurodevelopmental features. MIA in pregnant rodents induced by injection of the synthetic double-stranded RNA, Poly I:C, a mimic of viral infection, leads to a wide spectrum of behavioral abnormalities as well as structural and functional defects in the brain. Previous MIA studies using poly I:C prenatal treatment suggested that neurophysiological alterations occur in the hippocampus. However, these investigations used only juvenile or adult animals. We postulated that MIA-induced alterations could occur earlier at neonatal/early postnatal stages. Here we examined the neurophysiological properties of cultured pyramidal-like hippocampal neurons prepared from neonatal (P0-P2) offspring of pregnant rats injected with poly I:C. Offspring neurons from poly I:C-treated mothers exhibited significantly lower intrinsic excitability and stronger spike frequency adaptation, compared to saline. A similar lower intrinsic excitability was observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons from hippocampal slices of two weeks-old poly I:C offspring. Cultured hippocampal neurons also displayed lower frequency of spontaneous firing, higher charge transfer of IPSCs and larger amplitude of miniature IPSCs. Thus, maternal immune activation leads to strikingly early neurophysiological abnormalities in hippocampal neurons.},

   Abstract = {Because of the labor-intensive and time-consuming conventional protocols for the generation of dendritic cells (DCs) as the most promising tools for anti-cancer therapy that enable the induction of a T-helper (Th)1-mediated anti-tumor immune response, the use of short-term protocols has been proposed. However, data on the applicability of such protocols in cancer immunotherapy are quite limited.\\ We compared the phenotypic and functional capability of fast DCs (fDCs) differentiated for 24 h and then matured for 48 h with Poly (I:C), a strong Th1-promoting agent, with donor-matched conventional DCs (cDCs) differentiated for 5 days and matured likewise.\\ Of 12 donors tested, we identified seven whose monocytes failed to develop into immunogenic DCs through the use of fDC protocol, on the basis of incomplete downregulation of CD14, low expression of CD1a and macrophage-like morphology. Such fDCs have significantly lower expression of CD83, CD86, CCR7 and CD40, weaker allo-stimulatory Th1- and Th17-polarizing capacity caused by poor production of interleukin (IL)-12p70 and IL-23 and high production of IL-10, and prominent Th2-polarizing capacity, compared with donor-matched cDCs. Furthermore, such fDCs had tolerogenic properties as judged by higher expression of indolamine dioxigenase-3, IDO-1 and IL-1âÃ©Â¬â¤ and induction of a higher percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells. These findings correlated with increased transforming growth factor (TGF)-âÃ©Â¬â¤ production by fDC-primed CD3(+)T cells and their stronger anti-proliferative capacity.\\ We emphasize that although fDCs could probably be applied as an alternative to cDCs for cancer therapy, the fDC protocol should not be applied to donors whose DCs acquire tolerogenic capabilities.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Expression of the structural proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the direct interaction of multiple copies of the viral protein Rev with its target RNA, the Rev response element (RRE). RRE is a complex 351-nt RNA that is highly structured and located within the viral env gene. During initial Rev-RRE recognition, Rev binds with high affinity to a bubble structure located within the RRE RNA stem-loop II. We have used a site-specific photocrosslinking method based on 6-thioguanosine (6-thioG) photochemistry to probe the conformation of the high-affinity binding site of RRE RNA and its interactions with Rev protein under physiological conditions. A minimal duplex RNA containing the bubble region of RRE and 12 flanking base pairs was synthesized chemically. Two different RRE constructs with a single photoactive nucleoside (6-thio-dG or 6-thioG) at position 47 or 48 were synthesized. Upon UV irradiation, 6-thioG at both positions formed interstrand covalent crosslinks in RRE RNA. Mapping of crosslink sites by RNA sequencing revealed that 6-thioG at position 47 or 48 crosslinked to A73. In the presence of Rev, both RNA-RNA and RNA-protein crosslinks were observed, however, the RNA-RNA crosslink site was unchanged. Our results provide direct evidence that, during RNA-protein recognition, Rev is in close proximity to O6 of G47 and G48 in the major groove of RRE RNA. Our results also show that the bubble region of RRE RNA has a biologically relevant structure where G47 and G48 are in close proximity to A73 and this RNA structure is not changed significantly upon Rev binding. We propose that Rev protein recognizes and binds to specific structural elements of RRE RNA containing non-Watson-Crick base pairs and such structures could be a determinant for recognition by other RNA-binding proteins. Our site-specific crosslinking methods provide a general approach to capture dynamic states of biologically relevant RNA structures that are otherwise missed by NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies.},

   Abstract = {Specific gene expression involves the binding of natural ligands to the DNA base pairs. Among the compounds rationally designed for artificial regulation of gene expression, oligonucleotides can bind with a high specificity of recognition to the major groove of double helical DNA by forming Hoogsteen type bonds with purine bases of the Watson-Crick base pairs, resulting in triple helix formation. Although the potential target sequences were originally restricted to polypurine-polypyrimidine sequences, considerable efforts were devoted to the extension of the repertoire by rational conception of appropriate derivatives. Efficient tools based on triple helices were developed for various biochemical applications such as the development of highly specific artificial nucleases. The antigene strategy remains one of the most fascinating fields of triplex application to selectively control gene expression. Targeting of genomic sequences is now proved to be a valuable concept on a still limited number of studies; local mutagenesis is in this respect an interesting application of triplex-forming oligonucleotides on cell cultures. Oligonucleotide penetration and compartmentalization in cells, stability to intracellular nucleases, accessibility of the target sequences in the chromatin context, the residence time on the specific target are all limiting steps that require further optimization. The existence and the role of three-stranded DNA in vivo, its interaction with intracellular proteins is worth investigating, especially relative to the regulation of gene transcription, recombination and repair processes.},

Pregnant mice were randomly divided into 2 groups, receiving either 5 mg/kg Poly I:C or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intravenously at GD 17. Subsequently, the effects on whole brain enzymatic HDAC and DNMT activity and the protein levels of various HDAC isoforms were assessed in the offspring. Overall, a significant sex âÃ³ treatment interaction effect was observed after prenatal exposure to maternal immune challenge by Poly I:C, indicative of increased global HDAC activity particularly in female offspring from mothers injected with Poly I:C when compared to controls. Results on the levels of specific HDAC isoforms suggested that neither differences in the levels of HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4 or HDAC6 could explain the increased global HDAC activity observed in female Poly I:C offspring. In conclusion, we show that Poly I:C administration to pregnant mice alters global brain HDAC, but not DNMT activity in adult offspring, whereas it is still unclear which specific HDAC(s) mediate(s) this effect. These results indicate the necessity for further research on the epigenetic effects of Poly I:C.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {Calcineurin (CN) is a Ca(2+)/calmodulin(CaM)-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase which is a heterodimer composed of a 61 kDa catalytic subunit (CNA) and a 19 kDa regulatory subunit (CNB). The enzyme is critical for several important intracellular signal-transducing pathways, including T-cell activation. Its crystal structure reveals that the C-terminal of CNB lies in close vicinity of the N-terminal of CNA and each end has a long arm not involved in the active site. After fusing two subunits, it was determined that folding and function of the protein were not affected by the fusion. We amplified a fused gene of A and B subunits using a pair of linker primers including six codons of glycine. A single chain calcineurin was constructed and purified to near-homogeneity. The recombinant enzyme was fully soluble, displayed high specific activity with substrate, and exhibited biochemical properties and kinetic parameters similar to those of the native enzyme from the bovine brain. It was still activated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin but was not regulated by extra CNB and was still strongly stimulated by Mn(2+) and Ni(2+) divalent metal ions. The solution conformations of both recombinant enzyme and bovine calcineurin were assayed under the same conditions using intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, and results showed their graphs are approximately identical. Our findings suggested that the fusion of A and B subunits of calcineurin does not affect their folding pathways and structural changes involved in their function, furthermore, they are bound to the correct binding site.},

   Abstract = {The structure of human protein HSPC034 has been determined by both solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Refinement of the NMR structure ensemble, using a Rosetta protocol in the absence of NMR restraints, resulted in significant improvements not only in structure quality, but also in molecular replacement (MR) performance with the raw X-ray diffraction data using MOLREP and Phaser. This method has recently been shown to be generally applicable with improved MR performance demonstrated for eight NMR structures refined using Rosetta (Qian et al., Nature 2007;450:259-264). Additionally, NMR structures of HSPC034 calculated by standard methods that include NMR restraints have improvements in the RMSD to the crystal structure and MR performance in the order DYANA, CYANA, XPLOR-NIH, and CNS with explicit water refinement (CNSw). Further Rosetta refinement of the CNSw structures, perhaps due to more thorough conformational sampling and/or a superior force field, was capable of finding alternative low energy protein conformations that were equally consistent with the NMR data according to the Recall, Precision, and F-measure (RPF) scores. On further examination, the additional MR-performance shortfall for NMR refined structures as compared with the X-ray structure were attributed, in part, to crystal-packing effects, real structural differences, and inferior hydrogen bonding in the NMR structures. A good correlation between a decrease in the number of buried unsatisfied hydrogen-bond donors and improved MR performance demonstrates the importance of hydrogen-bond terms in the force field for improving NMR structures. The superior hydrogen-bond network in Rosetta-refined structures demonstrates that correct identification of hydrogen bonds should be a critical goal of NMR structure refinement. Inclusion of nonbivalent hydrogen bonds identified from Rosetta structures as additional restraints in the structure calculation results in NMR structures with improved MR performance.},

   Abstract = {A macromolecular structure, as measured data or as a list of coordinates or even on-screen as a full atomic model, is an extremely complex and confusing object. The underlying rules of how it folds, moves, and interacts as a biological entity are even less evident or intuitive to the human mind. To do science on such molecules, or to relate them usefully to higher levels of biology, we need to start with a natural history that names their features in meaningful ways and with multiple representations (visual or algebraic) that show some aspect of their organizing principles. The two of us have jointly enjoyed a highly varied and engrossing career in biophysical research over nearly 50 years. Our frequent changes of emphasis are tied together by two threads: first, by finding the right names, visualizations, and methods to help both ourselves and others to better understand the 3D structures of protein and RNA molecules, and second, by redefining the boundary between signal and noise for complex data, in both directions-sometimes identifying and promoting real signal up out of what seemed just noise, and sometimes demoting apparent signal into noise or systematic error.

   Abstract = {Replication of human immunodeficiency virus requires Tat protein which activates elongation of RNA polymerase II transcription at the HIV-1 promoter through interaction with the cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor complex (P-TEFb). Tat binds directly through its transactivation domain to the CycT1 subunit of the P-TEFb and induces loop sequence specific binding of the P-TEFb onto nascent HIV-1 TAR RNA. By using a gel electrophoresis method and a comprehensive set of TAR loop mutants, we have identified the sequence and structural determinants for high-affinity CycT1-Tat-TAR ternary complex formation. Our results show that CycT1 and Tat binding to TAR RNA is highly cooperative, and a capacity of 85%, a Hill coefficient of 2.7, and a dissociation constant (K(D)) of 2.45 nM were observed. These results indicate that there are three binding sites on TAR RNA. CycT1 does not bind TAR RNA in the absence of Tat, and Tat binding to TAR, while detectable, is very inefficient in the absence of CycT1. It is conceivable that the CycT1-Tat heterodimer directly binds to TAR RNA in the U-rich RNA bulge region and this binding facilitates the interactions of the CycT1-Tat heterodimer at the other two sites in the RNA loop region. On the basis of our results, we suggest a model where CycT1 interacts with Tat protein and positions the protein complex to make contacts with the G34 region of the loop sequence; G34 is critical for CycT1-Tat binding and forms a C30.G34 base pair. Two functional groups, O6 and N7, at nucleotide positions 32 and 34 in the TAR loop are essential for CycT1-Tat interactions with TAR RNA. The identity of two nucleotides, U31 and G33, is not critical, but they contribute to the stabilization of the RNA-protein complex. The presence of a single-nucleotide bulge of A35 or C35 is essential for distortion of the backbone RNA structure as well as the accessibility of functional groups in the major groove of the double-helical region. CycT1-Tat interaction with TAR RNA represents another example of the flexibility and complexity of RNA structure involved in protein recognition.},

   Abstract = {In T4 lysozyme, helix A is located at the amino terminus of the sequence but is associated with the C-terminal domain in the folded structure. To investigate the implications of this arrangement for the folding of the protein, we first created a circularly permuted variant with a new amino terminus at residue 12. In effect, this moves the sequence corresponding to helix A from the N- to the C-terminus of the molecule. The protein crystallized nonisomorphously with the wild type but has a very similar structure, showing that the unit consisting of helix A and the C-terminal domain can be reconstituted from a contiguous polypeptide chain. The protein is less stable than the wild type but folds slightly faster. We then produced a second variant in which the helix A sequence was appended at the C-terminus (as in the first variant), but was also restored at the N-terminus (as in the wild type). This variant has two helix A sequences, one at the N-terminus and the other at the C-terminus, each of which can compete for the same site in the folded protein. The crystal structure shows that it is the N-terminal sequence that folds in a manner similar to that of the wild type, whereas the copy at the C-terminus is forced to loop out. The stability of this protein is much closer to that of the wild type, but its rate of folding is significantly slower. The reduction in rate is attributed to the presence of the two identical sequence segments which compete for a single, mutually exclusive, site.},

   Abstract = {Type I interferons (IFNs), a family of cytokines, orchestrate numerous biological and cellular processes1, 2, 3. Although it is well known that type I IFNs are essential for establishing the host antiviral state4, their role in hematopoietic homeostasis has not been studied. Here we show that type I IFNs induce proliferation and exhaustion in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and that interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF2), a transcriptional suppressor of type I IFN signaling5, 6, preserves the self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capacity of HSCs. HSCs were substantially less abundant in the bone marrow of Irf2-/- as compared to Irf2+/- mice. Irf2-/- HSCs showed enhanced cell cycling status and failed to produce hematopoietic cells in competitive repopulation assays, and the reconstituting capacity of Irf2-/- HSCs was restored by disabling type I IFN signaling in these cells. In wild-type mice, injection of poly(I:C), an inducer of type I IFN signaling, or IFN- induced HSC proliferation, and chronic type I IFN signaling further reduced the number of quiescent HSCs. Notably, combined poly(I:C) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment allowed exogenous HSC engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution in WT mice. Our findings provide insight into the molecular basis for the maintenance of HSC quiescence and may lead to improvements in bone marrow transplantation and type I IFN-based therapies for viral infection and cancer.},

  abstract       = {Modern biotechnical research is becoming increasingly 	reliant on computational structural modeling programs to develop 	novel solutions to scientific questions. Rosetta is one such protein 	modeling suite that has already demonstrated wide applicability to a 	number of diverse research projects. Unfortunately, Rosetta is 	largely a command-line-driven software package which restricts its 	use among non-computational researchers. Some graphical interfaces 	for Rosetta exist, but typically are not as sophisticated as 	commercial software. Here, we present InteractiveROSETTA, a 	graphical interface for the PyRosetta framework that presents 	easy-to-use controls for several of the most widely used Rosetta 	protocols alongside a sophisticated selection system utilizing PyMOL 	as a visualizer. InteractiveROSETTA is also capable of interacting 	with remote Rosetta servers, facilitating sophisticated protocols 	that are not accessible in PyRosetta or which require greater 	computational resources. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: 	InteractiveROSETTA is freely available at 	https://github.com/schenc3/InteractiveROSETTA/releases and relies 	upon a separate download of PyRosetta which is available at 	http://www.pyrosetta.org after obtaining a license (free for 	academic use).

   Abstract = {Polyriboinosinic-polycytidylic acid with poly-L-lysine stabilized with carboxymethylcellulose [poly(I,C)-LC] augmented, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, secretion of colony-stimulating factor (CSF) by peritoneal macrophages (M phi) and bone marrow cells (BMC). Optimal effects were found after 2 days of in vitro culture of the cells with 50 micrograms/ml of poly(I,C)-LC or 14 h to 3 days after a single intraperitoneal injection of 1-2 mg/kg of poly(I,C)-LC into normal mice. The increase in CSF secretion by M phi and BMC was paralleled in vivo by an increase in serum CSF levels, followed by a rise in committed granulocyte and M phi progenitor cells (GM-CFU-C), nucleated BMC, and blood leukocytes of myelomonocytic origin. Poly(I,C)-LC at doses greater than 4 mg/kg, however, were strongly myelosuppressive. In vitro treatment of undifferentiated myelomonocytic leukemia cells from the WEHI-3B cell line with 10-1,000 micrograms/ml of poly(I,C)-LC resulted in a significant increase in CSF secretion by the leukemic cells and a concomitant inhibition of their proliferation. Incubation of cells from the WEHI-3B D+ subline, which differentiate in response to GM-CSF or G-CSF, with 50-100 micrograms/ml poly(I,C)-LC in agar cultures induced in approximately 45% of the leukemic colonies a differentiation into granulocytes and/or M phi. Poly(I,C)-LC, however, had no effect on differentiation of cells from the CSF unresponsive WEHI-3B D- subline. The CSF-inducing biological response modifier poly(I,C)-LC thus has the potential to stimulate growth and differentiation of normal, as well as differentiation of malignant myelopoietic progenitor cells.},

In vivo, the guide RNA gA6[14] is thought to specify the deletion of two uridines from the editing site closest to the 3' end. In this study, an in vitro system was developed that accurately removed uridines from this editing site in synthetic ATPase 6 pre-mRNA when gA6[14] and ATP were added. Mutations in both the guide RNA and the pre-mRNA editing site suggest that base-pairing interactions control the number of uridines deleted in vitro. Thus, guide RNAs are required for RNA editing and for the transfer of genetic information to pre-mRNAs.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, Skp1 is hydroxylated on proline 143 and further modified by three cytosolic glycosyltransferases to yield an O-linked pentasaccharide that contributes to O2 regulation of development. Skp1 is an adapter in the Skp1/cullin1/F-box protein family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that targets specific proteins for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. To investigate the biochemical consequences of glycosylation, untagged full-length Skp1 and several of its posttranslationally modified isoforms were expressed and purified to near homogeneity using recombinant and in vitro strategies. Interaction studies with the soluble mammalian F-box protein Fbs1/Fbg1/OCP1 revealed preferential binding to the glycosylated isoforms of Skp1. This difference correlated with the increased âÃ©Â¬Â±-helical and decreased âÃ©Â¬â¤-sheet content of glycosylated Skp1s based on circular dichroism and increased folding order based on small-angle X-ray scattering. A comparison of the molecular envelopes of fully glycosylated Skp1 and the apoprotein indicated that both isoforms exist as an antiparallel dimer that is more compact and extended in the glycosylated state. Analytical gel filtration and chemical cross-linking studies showed a growing tendency of less modified isoforms to dimerize. Considering that regions of free Skp1 are intrinsically disordered and Skp1 can adopt distinct folds when bound to F-box proteins, we propose that glycosylation, which occurs adjacent to the F-box binding site, influences the spectrum of energetically similar conformations that vary inversely in their propensity to dock with Fbs1 or another Skp1. Glycosylation may thus influence Skp1 function by modulating F-box protein binding in cells.},

   Abstract = {The 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5OAS) is a enzyme that catalyzes synthesis of 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) in a dsRNA-dependent manner, and known as a major component of the IFN-induced host defense mechanisms against microbial infections. Here, we report the presence of a novel 2-5OAS-like molecule, termed Oasl5, in mice. The size of Oasl5 cDNA was about 2 kb and encoded a protein consisting of 362 aa. The amino acid sequence showed 76% similarity to the mouse 2-5OAS, however, several motifs being important for the enzyme activity were not conserved. The Oasl5 mRNA was most significantly expressed in the brain, and relatively weak expression was found in other organs such as the spleen, kidney, ovary and testis. It was also expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Oasl5 mRNA expression in ES cells was elevated 5-fold after treatment with IFN and about 2-fold in the brain when stimulated with IFN inducer, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly[I:C]). In situ hybridization analysis revealed that Oasl5 is expressed in neurons in the central nervous system in adult mice. When Oasl5 was expressed in E. coli, it yielded 42 kDa protein that binds to dsRNA, but it did not show oligoadenylate synthetase activity. These findings suggest a novel function of Oasl5, which are independent of oligoadenylate synthetase activity, in the brain and developing embryos.},

   Abstract = {Large dsRNA molecules can cause potent cytotoxic and immunostimulatory effects through the activation of pattern recognition receptors; however, synthetic versions of these molecules are mostly limited to simple sequences like poly-I:C and poly-A:U. Here we show that large RNA molecules generated by rolling circle transcription fold into periodic-shRNA (p-shRNA) structures and cause potent cytotoxicity and gene silencing when delivered to cancer cells. We determined structural requirements for the dumbbell templates used to synthesize p-shRNA, and showed that these molecules likely adopt a co-transcriptionally folded structure. The cytotoxicity of p-shRNA was robustly observed across four different cancer cell lines using two different delivery systems. Despite having a considerably different folded structure than conventional dsRNA, the cytotoxicity of p-shRNA was either equal to or substantially greater than that of poly-I:C depending on the delivery vehicle. Furthermore, p-shRNA caused greater NF-âÃ©Â¬â«B activation in SKOV3 cells compared to poly-I:C, indicating that it is a powerful activator of innate immunity. The tuneable sequence and combined gene silencing, immunostimulatory and cytotoxic capacity of p-shRNA make it an attractive platform for cancer immunotherapy.},

   Abstract = {In the present study, we used high-throughput sequencing, miRNA-seq, to discover and explore the expression profiles of known and novel miRNAs in TLR ligand-stimulated vis-ââ -vis non-stimulated (i.e. Control) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from blood of healthy Murrah buffaloes. Six small RNA (sRNA) libraries were multiplexed in Ion Torrent PI chip and sequenced on Ion Proton System. The reads obtained were aligned to the Bos taurus genome (UMD3.1 assembly), which is phylogenetically closest species to buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). A total of 160 bovine miRNAs were biocomputationally identified in buffalo PBMCs and 130 putatively novel miRNAs (not enlisted in the bovine mirBase) were identified. All of these 290 miRNAs identified across the six treatment and control samples represent the repertoire of novel miRNAs for the buffalo species. The expression profiles of these miRNAs across the samples have been represented by sample dendrogram and heatmap plots. The uniquely expressed miRNAs in each treatment and control groups were identified. A few miRNAs were expressed at very high levels while the majority of them were moderately expressed. The miRNAs bta-miR-103 and -191 were found to be highly abundant and expressed in all the samples. Other abundantly expressed miRNAs include bta-miR-19b, -29b, -15a, -19a, -30d, -30b-5p and members of let family (let 7a-5p, let 7g & let 7f) in LPS and CpG treated PBMCS and bta-miR-191, -103 & -19b in Poly I:C stimulated PBMCs. Only one novel miRNA (bta-miR-11039) out of 130 identified putatively novel miRNAs, was expressed in all the six samples and differentially expressed (>2- fold) miRNAs were identified. Six of the differentially expressed miRNAs across the groups (bta-miR-421, bta-let-7i, bta-miR-138, bta-miR-21-5p, bta-miR-222 and bta-miR-27b) were subsequently confirmed by TaqMan quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for the roles in innate immunity and TLR signaling pathways. This maiden study on profiling and cataloguing of bubaline miRNAs expressed in TLR-ligand stimulated PBMCs will provide an important reference point for future studies on regulatory roles of miRNAs in immune system of buffaloes.},

   Abstract = {The purine nucleoside analogs fludarabine, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine, and 2'-deoxycoformycin exhibit impressive activity in lymphoproliferative malignancies of adults and children. Their mechanism of action is not clear. Studies have suggested that their use is associated with significant myelosuppression, immunosuppression, and in some circumstances, increased infection with viral and opportunistic pathogens. Because interferons (IFNs) are known to have immunomodulatory activity as well as potent antiproliferative and antiviral activity, we examined whether the chemotherapeutic purine nucleoside analogs alter interferon-beta (IFN-B) gene expression in MG63 in human osteosarcoma cells. Northern blot analysis showed a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-B mRNA accumulation in response to a known inducer (Poly I-Poly C) all three purine analogs. Hybridization analysis also revealed that inhibition of IFN-beta mRNA accumulation by the purine analogs is not a result of decreased mRNA stability. Further analysis of gene expression by PCR differential display indicated that the effect of the purine analogs was restricted to only a limited number of inducible genes. The data suggest that these molecules alter the signaling process involved in regulating the expression of specific genes, including IFN-beta. These findings predict that the use of purine nucleoside analogs may reduce IFN production in vivo and thereby abrogate host defenses against infectious pathogens.},

   Abstract = {X-ray, phylogenetic and quantum chemical analysis of molecular interactions and conservation patterns of cis Watson-Crick (W.C.) A/G base-pairs in 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and other molecules was carried out. In these base-pairs, the A and G nucleotides interact with their W.C. edges with glycosidic bonds oriented cis relative to each other. The base-pair is stabilised by two hydrogen bonds, the C1'-C1' distance is enlarged and the G(N2) amino group is left unpaired. Quantum chemical calculations show that, in the absence of other interactions, the unpaired amino group is substantially non-planar due to its partial sp(3) pyramidalization, while the whole base-pair is internally propeller twisted and very flexible. The unique molecular properties of the cis W.C. A/G base-pairs make them distinct from other base-pairs. They occur mostly at the ends of canonical helices, where they serve as interfaces between the helix and other motifs. The cis W.C. A/G base-pairs play crucial roles in natural RNA structures with salient sequence conservation patterns. The key contribution to conservation is provided by the unpaired G(N2) amino group that is involved in a wide range of tertiary and neighbor contacts in the crystal structures. Many of them are oriented out of the plane of the guanine base and utilize the partial sp(3) pyramidalization of the G(N2). There is a lack of A/G to G/A covariation, which, except for the G(N2) position, would be entirely isosteric. On the contrary, there is a rather frequent occurrence of G/A to G/U covariation, as the G/U wobble base-pair has an unpaired amino group in the same position as the cis W.C. G/A base-pair. The cis W.C. A/G base-pairs are not conserved when there is no tertiary or neighbor interaction. Obtaining the proper picture of the interactions and phylogenetic patterns of the cis W.C. A/G base-pairs requires a detailed analysis of the relation between the molecular structures and the energetics of interactions at a level of single H-bonds and contacts.},

   Abstract = {Colony growth in soft agar was used to identify human tumors that were sensitive to the direct antiproliferative effects of mismatched dsRNA (Ampligen). The results suggest that different human solid malignancies vary significantly in their sensitivity to Ampligen. Tumors with 50% or more of their surgical specimens showing sensitivity included carcinoid, glioblastoma, and carcinomas of the kidney, and lung. Resistant tumors (less than 15% sensitivity) included sarcomas and colo-rectal carcinomas. Overall, 42% of the tumor specimens studied showed a 50% or greater reduction in tumor cell colony formation after a single initial treatment with Ampligen (250 micrograms/ml). Interestingly, one patient's tumor which was de novo sensitive to interferon (IFN), but emerged as IFN-resistant following IFN therapy, remained sensitive to Ampligen. Thus, a clonogenic assay may prove useful in identifying human tumors and individuals for clinical trials with Ampligen, including patients resistant to IFN.},

   Abstract = {The understanding of how genetic information is stored and expressed has advanced considerably since the "central dogma" asserted that genetic information flows from the nucleotide sequence of DNA to that of messenger RNA (mRNA) which in turn specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein. It was found that genetic information can be stored as RNA (e.g. in RNA viruses) and can flow from RNA to DNA by reverse transcriptase enzyme activity. In addition, some genes contain introns, nucleotide sequences that are removed from their RNA (by RNA splicing) and thus are not represented in the resultant protein. Furthermore, alternative splicing was found to produce variant proteins from a single gene. More recently, the study of trypanosome parasites revealed an unexpected and indeed counter-intuitive genetic complexity. Genetic information for a single protein can be dispersed among several (DNA) genes in these organisms. One of these genes specifies an encrypted precursor mRNA that is converted to a functional mRNA by a process called RNA editing that inserts and deletes uridylate nucleotides. The sequence of the edited mRNA is specified by multiple small RNAs, named guide RNAs, (gRNAs) each of which is encoded in a separate gene. Thus, edited mRNA sequences are assembled from multiple genes by the transfer of information from one type of RNA to another. The existence of editing was surprising but has stimulated the discovery of other types of RNA editing. The Stuart laboratory has been exploring RNA editing in trypanosomes from the time of its discovery. They found dramatic differences between the mitochondrial gene sequences and those of the corresponding mRNAs, which indicated editing by the insertion and deletion of uridylates. Some editing was modest; simply eliminating shifts in sequence register of minimally extending the protein coding sequence. However, editing of many mRNAs was startingly extensive. The RNA sequence was essentially entirely remodeled with its sequence more the result of editing than the gene sequence. The identities of genes for such extensively edited RNA were not recognizable from the DNA sequence but they were readily identifiable from the edited mRNA sequence. Thus, despite the complex and extensive editing the resultant mRNA sequence is precise. Characterization of partially edited RNAs indicated that editing proceeds in the direction opposite to that used to specify the protein which reflects the use of the gRNAs. The numerous gRNAs that are used for editing are encoded in the DNA molecules whose role was previously a mystery. Using information gained in our earlier studies, the Stuart group developed an in vitro system that reproduces the fundamental process of editing in order to resolve the mechanism by which it occurs. They determined that editing entails a series of enzymatic steps rather than the mechanism used in RNA splicing. They also showed that chimeric gRNA-mRNA molecules are aberrant by-products of editing rather than intermediates in the process as had been proposed. Additional studies are exploring precisely how the number of added and deleted uridylates is specified by the gRNA. The Stuart laboratory showed that editing is performed by an aggregation of enzymes that catalyze the separate steps of editing. It also developed a method to purify this multimolecule complex that contains several, perhaps tens of, proteins. This will allow the study of its composition and the functions of its component parts. Indeed, the gene for one component has been identified and its detailed characterization begun. These studies are developing tools to explore related processes. An early finding in the lab was that the various mRNAs are differentially edited during the life cycle of the parasite. The pattern of this editing indicates that editing serves to regulate the alternation between two modes of energy generation. This regulation is coordinated with other events that are occurring during the life c},

   Abstract = {Dengue is a common arthropod-borne flaviviral infection in the tropics, for which there is no vaccine or specific antiviral drug. The infection is often associated with serious complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS), in which both viral and host factors have been implicated. RNA interference (RNAi) is a potent antiviral strategy and a potential therapeutic option for dengue if a feasible strategy can be developed for delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, the major in vivo targets of the virus and also the source of proinflammatory cytokines. Here we show that a dendritic cell-targeting 12-mer peptide (DC3) fused to nona-D-arginine (9dR) residues (DC3-9dR) delivers siRNA and knocks down endogenous gene expression in heterogenous DC subsets, (monocyte-derived DCs [MDDCs], CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cell [HSC])-derived Langerhans DCs, and peripheral blood DCs). Moreover, DC3-9dR-mediated delivery of siRNA targeting a highly conserved sequence in the dengue virus envelope gene (siFvE(D)) effectively suppressed dengue virus replication in MDDCs and macrophages. In addition, DC-specific delivery of siRNA targeting the acute-phase cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), which plays a major role in dengue pathogenesis, either alone or in combination with an antiviral siRNA, significantly reduced virus-induced production of the cytokine in MDDCs. Finally to validate the strategy in vivo, we tested the ability of the peptide to target human DCs in the NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgamma(-/-) mouse model engrafted with human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HuHSC mice). Treatment of mice by intravenous (i.v.) injection of DC3-9dR-complexed siRNA targeting TNF-alpha effectively suppressed poly(I:C)-induced TNF-alpha production by DCs. Thus, DC3-9dR can deliver siRNA to DCs both in vitro and in vivo, and this delivery approach holds promise as a therapeutic strategy to simultaneously suppress virus replication and curb virus-induced detrimental host immune responses in dengue infection.},

   Abstract = {Human genetic trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases (TREDs) are characterized by triplet repeat expansions, most frequently found as CNG-tracts in genome. At RNA level, such expansions suggestively result in formation of double-helical hairpins that become a potential source for small RNAs involved in RNA interference (RNAi). Here, we present three crystal structures of RNA fragments composed of triplet repeats CUG and CGG/CUG, as well as two crystal structures of same triplets in a protein-bound state. We show that both 20mer pG(CUG)(6)C and 19mer pGG(CGG)(3)(CUG)(2)CC form A-RNA duplexes, in which U.U or G.U mismatches are flanked/stabilized by two consecutive Watson-Crick G.C base pairs resulting in high-stacking GpC steps in every third position of the duplex. Despite interruption of this regularity in another 19mer, p(CGG)(3)C(CUG)(3), the oligonucleotide still forms regular double-helical structure, characterized, however, by 12 bp (rather than 11 bp) per turn. Analysis of newly determined molecular structures reveals the dynamic aspects of U.U and G.U mismatching within CNG-repetitive A-RNA and in a protein-bound state, as well as identifies an additional mode of U.U pairing essential for its dynamics and sheds the light on possible role of regularity of trinucleotide repeats for double-helical RNA structure. Findings are important for understanding the structural behavior of CNG-repetitive RNA double helices implicated in TREDs.},

   Abstract = {Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the United States. Prostate cancer therapy is severely hampered by lack of response and development of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in patients. Therefore, the development and discovery of new drugs have become an urgent clinical need. Interferons (IFNs), a family of pleiotropic cytokines, exert antitumor activities due to their anti-proliferative, immunomodulatory and proapoptotic functions. Here, we report that pretreatment of prostate cancer PC-3 cells with IFNs sensitized these cells to double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs)-induced apoptosis. The enhancement effect of IFN treatment was dependent on IFN subtypes, in particular, IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥. In comparison with IFN âÃ©Â¬Â± or âÃ©Â¬â¤, IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥ treatment remarkably augmented apoptosis in PC-3 cells induced with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthesized form of dsRNA. We demonstrated that IFN-signaling was necessary for these effects by using mutant cell lines. Transfection of 2-5A, the activator of RNase L, or silencing of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) by siRNA did not have any significant impact on this event, suggesting that neither RNase L nor PKR was involved in poly I:C/IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥-induced apoptosis in the cells. Further investigation of the apoptotic pathway revealed that Bak, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2family, was synergistically up-regulated by IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥ and poly I:C, whereas other members of the family were not affected. Knocking down of Bak demonstrated its contribution to poly I:C/IFN âÃ©Â¬â¥-induced apoptosis in the cells. We believeour findings will precipitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies for prostate cancer.},

   Abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most contagious and economically important diseases of cloven-hoofed livestock. Currently used inactivated FMD vaccines have short lived immunity besides risk of handling live virus. We studied recombinant FMD virus like particles (VLPs) encoded by FMDV type O/IND/R2/75 polyprotein genes expressed in Sf9 cells and adjuvanted with CpG or Poly I:C in inducing protective immune response in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs immunized with VLP + CpG vaccine had shown markedly higher cell mediated immunity (CMI) in comparison to the conventional vaccine group as evident from higher levels of IgG2 than IgG1. Although the humoral response was less in VLP + CpG compared to conventional vaccine, the lymphocyte stimulation index was more in VLP + CpG compared to conventional and VLP + Poly I:C vaccine groups. Finally the challenge experiments on 28 and 56 dpv had shown 75% protection in VLP + CpG immunized guinea pigs primary and boosted animals, while 50% and 62% protection in VLP + Poly I:C in primary and boosted animals, respectively. In conclusion, CpG adjuvant was found to be superior followed by ISA206 and Poly I:C in eliciting protection in VLP based FMD vaccines in guinea pigs.},

Instead of adding a phase shift to the heavy-atom phases to obtain a starting value for the native protein phase, this phase shift is subtracted from the native phase to obtain the heavy-atom substructure phase. The required native phase is calculated from the information in a Protein Data Bank file of the structure. The resulting density enables even very weak anomalous scatterers such as sulfur to be located.

   Abstract = {The molecular-replacement method has been extended to locate molecules and their fragments in an electron-density map. The approach is based on a new spherically averaged phased translation function. The position of the centre of mass of a search model is found prior to determination of its orientation. The orientation is subsequently found by a phased rotation function. The technique also allows superposition of distantly related macromolecules. The method has been implemented in a computer program MOLREP and successfully tested using experimental data sets.},

   Abstract = {Influenza neuraminidase (NA) is an important target for antiviral inhibitors since its active site is highly conserved such that inhibitors can be cross-reactive against multiple types and subtypes of influenza. Here, we discuss the crystal structure of neuraminidase subtype N9 complexed with a new benzoic acid based inhibitor (2) that was designed to add contacts by overpacking one side of the active site pocket. Inhibitor 2 uses benzoic acid to mimic the pyranose ring, a bis-(hydroxymethyl)-substituted 2-pyrrolidinone ring in place of the N-acetyl group of the sialic acid, and a branched aliphatic structure to fill the sialic acid C6 subsite.\\ Inhibitor 2 {4-[2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)-5-oxo-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-3-[(dipropylamino)methyl)]benzoic acid} was soaked into crystals of neuraminidase of A/tern/Australia/G70c/75 (N9), and the structure refined with 1.55 âÃ X-ray data. The benzene ring of the inhibitor tilted 8.9Â¬â compared to the previous compound (1), and the number of contacts, including hydrogen bonds, increased. However, the IC50 for compound 2 remained in the low micromolar range, likely because one propyl group was disordered. In this high-resolution structure of NA isolated from virus grown in chicken eggs, we found electron density for additional sugar units on the N-linked glycans compared to previous neuraminidase structures. In particular, seven mannoses and two N-acetylglucosamines are visible in the glycan attached to Asn200. This long, branched high-mannose glycan makes significant contacts with the neighboring subunit.\\ We designed inhibitor 2 with an extended substituent at C4-corresponding to C6 of sialic acid-to increase the contact surface in the C6-subsite and to force the benzene ring to tilt to maximize these interactions while retaining the interactions of the carboxylate and the pyrolidinone substituents. The crystal structure at 1.55 âÃ showed that we partially succeeded in that the ring in 2 is tilted relative to 1 and the number of contacts increased, but one hydrophobic branch makes no contacts, perhaps explaining why the IC50 did not decrease. Future design efforts will include branches of unequal length so that both branches may be accommodated in the C6-subsite without conformational disorder. The high-mannose glycan attached to Asn200 makes several inter-subunit contacts and appears to stabilize the tetramer.},

   Abstract = {Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) studies in schizophrenia patients generally report decreased levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), glutamate and glutathione, particularly in frontal cortex. However, these data are inconsistent in part due to confounds associated with clinical samples. The lack of validated diagnostic biomarkers also hampers analysis of the neurodevelopmental trajectory of neurochemical abnormalities. Rodent models are powerful tools to address these issues, particularly when combined with (1)H MRS (clinically comparable technology). We investigated the trajectory of metabolic changes in the prefrontal cortex during brain maturation from adolescence to adulthood in vivo using (1)H MRS in rats exposed prenatally to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (POL), a rodent model of maternal immune activation (MIA), an epidemiological risk factor for several psychiatric disorders with a neurodevelopmental origin. Longitudinal in vivo (1)H MRS revealed a significant decrease in PFC levels of GSH and taurine in adult, but not adolescent rats. Significant ageâÃ³MIA interactions for PFC levels of NAA were also observed. These data replicate some deficits observed in the PFC of patients with schizophrenia. There were no significant changes in the levels of glutamate or any other metabolite. These data suggest prenatal exposure to POL leads to subtle metabolic perturbations of the normal maturing PFC, which may be related to subsequent behavioural abnormalities. Further work is however required to examine any potential confound of shipping stress on the presumed imbalances in PFC metabolites in POL-exposed offspring. Testing the interactions between MIA with stress or genetic risk variants will also be an important advance.},

   Abstract = {Lymphocyte count is an important phenotypic metric that has been reported to be related to the individual antiviral capacity of pigs and other mammals. To date, aside from information regarding several genes and pathways, little is known about the mechanism by which gene expression affects variation in lymphocyte count. In this work, we investigated the lymphocyte count variation after poly I:C stimulation and compared the transcriptomes of pigs with large and small differences of lymphocyte counts before and after poly I:C stimulation. Pigs with large and small differences of lymphocyte counts were designated as extreme response (ER) and moderate response (MR) pigs respectively. Lymphocyte counts in all animals were observed to decline after poly I:C stimulation. Transcriptomic analysis identified 1121 transcripts (981 differentially expressed genes) in MR pigs and 1045 transcripts (904 differentially expressed genes) in ER pigs. We found that the majority of the differentially expressed genes were involved in both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, the innate immune response of ER pigs was more rapid than that of MR pigs. Results indicated that the activation of signaling pathways associated with cell death, cytotoxicity and apoptosis may contribute to the poly I:C-induced decrease of lymphocyte counts in the periphery. Moreover, the differential expression patterns of chemokines and FAS either totally or partially provided an interpretation for the different degrees of decrease in the lymphocyte counts between MR and ER pigs. Overall, our study will provide further understanding of the molecular basis for the antiviral capacity of pigs and other mammals.},

   Abstract = {Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are considered to be a promising cell source for regenerative medicine because of their unlimited capacity for self-renewal and differentiation. However, little is known about the innate immunity in ESCs and ESC-derived cells. We investigated the responses of mouse (m)ESCs to three types of live viruses as follows: La Crosse virus, West Nile virus, and Sendai virus. Our results demonstrated mESCs were susceptible to viral infection, but they were unable to express type I interferons (IFNâÃ©Â¬Â± and IFNâÃ©Â¬â¤, IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤), which differ from fibroblasts (10T1/2 cells) that robustly express IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤ upon viral infections. The failure of mESCs to express IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤ was further demonstrated by treatment with polyIC, a synthetic viral dsRNA analog that strongly induced IFNâÃ©Â¬Â±/âÃ©Â¬â¤ in 10T1/2 cells. Although polyIC transiently inhibited the transcription of pluripotency markers, the stem cell morphology was not significantly affected. However, polyIC can induce dsRNA-activated protein kinase in mESCs, and this activation resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation. We conclude that the cytosolic receptor dsRNA-activated protein kinase is functional, but the mechanisms that mediate type I IFN expression are deficient in mESCs. This conclusion is further supported by the findings that the major viral RNA receptors are either expressed at very low levels (TLR3 and MDA5) or may not be active (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) in mESCs.},

   Abstract = {The stabilities and structures of a series of RNA octamers containing symmetric tandem mismatches were studied by UV melting and imino proton NMR. The free energy increments for tandem mismatch formation are found to depend upon both mismatch sequence and adjacent base pairs. The observed sequence dependence of tandem mismatch stability is UGGU > GUUG > GAAG > or = AGGA > UUUU > CAAC > or = CUUC approximately UCCU approximately CCCC approximately ACCA approximately AAAA, and the closing base pair dependence is 5'G3'C > 5'C3'G > 5'U3'A approximately 5'A3'U. These results differ from expectations based on models used in RNA folding algorithms and from the sequence dependence observed for folding of RNA hairpins. Imino proton NMR results indicate the sequence dependence is partially due to hydrogen bonding within mismatches.},

   Abstract = {Multi-component molecular complexes are increasingly being tackled by structural biology, bringing X-ray crystallography into the purview of electron-microscopy (EM) studies. X-ray crystallography can utilize a low-resolution EM map for structure determination followed by phase extension to high resolution. Test studies have been conducted on five crystal structures of large molecular assemblies, in which EM maps are used as models for structure solution by molecular replacement (MR) using various standard MR packages such as AMoRe, MOLREP and Phaser. The results demonstrate that EM maps are viable models for molecular replacement. Possible difficulties in data analysis, such as the effects of the EM magnification error, and the effect of MR positional/rotational errors on phase extension are discussed.},

   Abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be polarized into two distinct populations, MSC1 and MSC2, by activation of different Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLR4-primed MSC1 expressed proinflammatory factors, whereas TLR3-primed MSC2 expressed suppressive factors. However, little is known about the function of TLRs on B lymphocyte-related immune modulation. In this study, we investigated the expression of B cell activating factor (BAFF), a member of the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily with notable stimulating activity on B cells, in human MSCs (hMSCs) and in murine MSCs (mMSCs) after activation of TLRs. BAFF was increasingly expressed in presence of TLR4 agonist (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), while TLR2 agonist (Zymosan) and TLR3-agonist (polyinocinic-polycytidykic acid, poly I:C) had no effect on BAFF expression. In addition, we demonstrated that signaling pathways of NF-âÃ©Â¬â«B, p38 MAPK, and JNK were involved in TLR4-primed BAFF expression. Our results suggested that TLR4 and downstream pathways in MSCs exert an important function in B lymphocyte-related immune regulation. Further defining a homogeneous population of MSCs should provide insight into MSC-based immune-modulating therapy.},

   Abstract = {Recognition of viral dsRNA by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) leads to induction of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, and innate antiviral response. Here we identified the RNA-binding protein Mex3B as a positive regulator of TLR3-mediated signaling by expression cloning screens. Cells from Mex3b(-/-) mice exhibited reduced production of IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ in response to the dsRNA analog poly(I:C) but not infection with RNA viruses. Mex3b(-/-) mice injected with poly(I:C) was more resistant to poly(I:C)-induced death. Mex3B was associated with TLR3 in the endosomes. It bound to dsRNA and increased the dsRNA-binding activity of TLR3. Mex3B also promoted the proteolytic processing of TLR3, which is critical for its activation. Mutants of Mex3B lacking its RNA-binding activity inhibited TLR3-mediated IFN-âÃ©Â¬â¤ induction. These findings suggest that Mex3B acts as a coreceptor of TLR3 in innate antiviral response.},

   owner = {blaine-mooers},

   Abstract = {RNA silencing (also known as RNA interference) is a conserved biological response to double-stranded RNA that regulates gene expression, and has evolved in plants as a defence against viruses. The response is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which guide the sequence-specific degradation of cognate messenger RNAs. As a counter-defence, many viruses encode proteins that specifically inhibit the silencing machinery. The p19 protein from the tombusvirus is such a viral suppressor of RNA silencing and has been shown to bind specifically to siRNA. Here, we report the 1.85-A crystal structure of p19 bound to a 21-nucleotide siRNA, where the 19-base-pair RNA duplex is cradled within the concave face of a continuous eight-stranded beta-sheet, formed across the p19 homodimer interface. Direct and water-mediated intermolecular contacts are restricted to the backbone phosphates and sugar 2'-OH groups, consistent with sequence-independent p19-siRNA recognition. Two alpha-helical 'reading heads' project from opposite ends of the p19 homodimer and position pairs of tryptophans for stacking over the terminal base pairs, thereby measuring and bracketing both ends of the siRNA duplex. Our structure provides an illustration of siRNA sequestering by a viral protein.},

   Abstract = {Viral infections can disturb the functions of adipose tissue and results and thus result in metabolic diseases. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA, induces innate antiviral responses by mimicking viral infection through the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). Poly(I:C) also inhibits the differentiation of mouse preadipocytes, but the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. In this study, poly(I:C) inhibited preadipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner, but not in a time-dependent manner. Endogenously transfected poly(I:C) severely impaired the adipogenesis of preadipocytes compared with exogenously added poly(I:C). Low concentration of tumor necrosis factor-âÃ©Â¬Â± (TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â±) could effectively inhibit the preadipocyte differentiation. The effect of exogenously added poly(I:C) on inhibition of differentiation was significantly diminished in the preadipocytes of TLR3 knockout mice. By contrast, endogenously transfected poly(I:C) still inhibited the differentiation of TLR3-deficient preaidpocytes. Hence, MDA5/RIG-I signaling was involved in the poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation. The effect of poly(I:C) stimulation, either through endogenous transfection or exogenous addition, on inhibition of differentiation was significantly diminished in the preadipocytes of TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â± knockout mice. These results confirmed the evidence that poly(I:C) inhibited the differentiation of mouse preadipocytes through PRR-mediated secretion of TNF-âÃ©Â¬Â±.Immunology and Cell Biology accepted article preview online, 17 June 2016. doi:10.1038/icb.2016.57.},

   Abstract = {Type III interferons (IFN-âÃ©Â¬Âªs) comprise a group of newly identified antiviral cytokines that are functionally similar to type I IFNs and elicit first-line antiviral responses. Recently, type III IFNs were identified in several species; however, little information is available about type III IFNs in ducks. We compared the expression of type III IFNs and their receptor in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEFs) and duck embryonic fibroblasts (DEFs) in response to influenza virus infection. The results showed that the expression of type III IFNs was upregulated in both DEFs and CEFs following infection with H1N1 influenza virus or treatment with poly (I:C), and expression levels were significantly higher in CEFs than in DEFs at each time point. The expression of the receptor for type III IFNs (IL-28RâÃ©Â¬Â±) was also upregulated following infection with H1N1 virus or treatment with poly (I:C) and was significantly higher in CEFs than in DEFs at each time point. The expression of the receptor for type III IFNs occurred from 8 hpi and remained at similar levels until 36 hpi in CEFs, but the expression level was elevated from 36 hpi in DEFs.

   Abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive candidates for clinical therapeutic applications. Recent studies indicate MSCs express active Toll-like receptors (TLRs), but their effect on MSCs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that, after treating human umbilical cord MSCs with various TLR ligands, only TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C), could significantly increase the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, poly(I:C) could enhance MSCs' anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Next, we focused on the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the process of poly(I:C) activating MSCs. Our experiments indicated that miR-143 expression was significantly decreased in MSCs with poly(I:C) treatment, and the expression level of miR-143 could regulate the effect of poly(I:C) on MSCs' immunosuppressive function. Subsequent results showed that the reporter genes with putative miR-143 binding sites from the transforming growth factor-âÃ©Â¬â¤-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and COX-2 3' untranslated regions were downregulated in the presence of miR-143. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of TAK1 and COX-2 in MSCs was also downregulated with miR-143 overexpression, suggesting that TAK1 and COX-2 are target genes of miR-143 in MSCs. Consistent with miR-143 overexpression, TAK1 interference also attenuated MSCs' immunosuppressive function enhanced by poly(I:C). Additionally, it was shown that TLR3-activated MSCs could improve survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, while miR-143 overexpression reduced the effectiveness of this therapy. These results proved that poly(I:C) improved the immunosuppressive abilities of MSCs, revealed the regulatory role of miRNAs in the process, and may provide an opportunity for potential novel therapies for sepsis.},

  abstract       = {The upstream site of cleavage of all group I self-splicing introns is identified by an absolutely conserved U.G base pair. Although a wobble C.A pair can substitute the U.G pair, all other combinations of nucleotides at this position abolish splicing, suggesting that it is an unusual RNA structure, rather than sequence, that is recognized by the catalytic intron core. RNA enzymes are metalloenzymes, and divalent metal ion binding may be an important requirement for splice site recognition and catalysis. The paramagnetic broadening of NMR resonances upon manganese binding at specific sites was used to probe the interaction between divalent metal ions and an oligonucleotide model of a group I intron ribozyme substrate. Unlike previous studies in which only imino proton resonances were monitored, we have used isotopically labelled RNA and a set of complete spectral assignments to identify the location of the divalent metal binding site with much greater detail than previously possible. Two independent metal binding sites were identified for this oligonucleotide. A first metal binding site is located in the major groove of the three consecutive G.C base pairs at the end of double helical stem. A second site is found in the major groove of the RNA double helix in the vicinity of the U.G base pair. These results suggest that metal ion coordination (or a metal bridge) and tertiary interactions identified biochemically, may be used by group I intron ribozymes for substrate recognition.},

Advances in sample preparation, crystallization techniques, cryocrystallography, access to synchrotron radiation, and crystallographic software continue to accelerate the structure determination of nucleic acids. Crystallographic studies of DNA and RNA molecules share many considerations that we outline here. The application of crystallography to RNA is illustrated with the structure determination of the CUG repeat that is linked to type I myotonic dystrophy.},

  abstract       = {Mutant R96H is a classic temperature-sensitive mutant of bacteriophage T4 lysozyme. It was in fact the first variant of the protein to be characterized structurally. Subsequently, it has been studied extensively by a variety of experimental and computational techniques, but the reasons for the loss of stability of the mutant protein remain controversial. In the crystallographic refinement of the mutant structure at 1.9 \AA resolution one of the bond angles at the site of substitution appeared to be distorted by about 11( degrees ), and it was suggested that this steric strain was one of the major factors in destabilizing the mutant. Different computationally-derived models of the mutant structure, however, did not show such distortion. To determine the geometry at the site of mutation more reliably, we have extended the resolution of the data and refined the wildtype (WT) and mutant structures to be better than 1.1 A resolution. The high-resolution refinement of the structure of R96H does not support the bond angle distortion seen in the 1.9 \AA structure determination. At the same time, it does confirm other manifestations of strain seen previously including an unusual rotameric state for His96 with distorted hydrogen bonding. The rotamer strain has been estimated as about 0.8 kcal/mol, which is about 25% of the overall reduction in stability of the mutant. Because of concern that contacts from a neighboring molecule in the crystal might influence the geometry at the site of mutation we also constructed and analyzed supplemental mutant structures in which this crystal contact was eliminated. High-resolution refinement shows that the crystal contacts have essentially no effect on the conformation of Arg96 in WT or on His96 in the R96H mutant.},

  abstract       = {\Gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase 1 (GGT1) is a cell surface, N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase that cleaves glutathione and other âÃ©Â¬â¥-glutamyl compounds. GGT1 expression is essential in cysteine homeostasis, and its induction has been implicated in the pathology of asthma, reperfusion injury, and cancer. In this study, we report four new crystal structures of human GGT1 (hGGT1) that show conformational changes within the active site as the enzyme progresses from the free enzyme to inhibitor-bound tetrahedral transition states and finally to the glutamate-bound structure prior to the release of this final product of the reaction. The structure of the apoenzyme shows flexibility within the active site. The serine-borate-bound hGGT1 crystal structure demonstrates that serine-borate occupies the active site of the enzyme, resulting in an enzyme-inhibitor complex that replicates the enzyme's tetrahedral intermediate/transition state. The structure of GGsTop-bound hGGT1 reveals its interactions with the enzyme and why neutral phosphonate diesters are more potent inhibitors than monoanionic phosphonates. These structures are the first structures for any eukaryotic GGT that include a molecule in the active site covalently bound to the catalytic Thr-381. The glutamate-bound structure shows the conformation of the enzyme prior to release of the final product and reveals novel information regarding the displacement of the main chain atoms that form the oxyanion hole and movement of the lid loop region when the active site is occupied. These data provide new insights into the mechanism of hGGT1-catalyzed reactions and will be invaluable in the development of new classes of hGGT1 inhibitors for therapeutic use.},

  abstract = {The holographic method for the recovery of the electron density of macromolecules is based on the expansion of the electron density into Gaussian basis functions. The technique makes consistent use of real- and reciprocal-space information to produce electron-density maps. It enforces positivity of the recovered electron density and makes effective use of previously known information about the electron density, such as knowledge of a solvent region or knowledge of a partial structure. In this paper, we summarize the theory underlying the holographic method, and describe how we extend the range of information that can be used by the method to include information from multiple-isomorphous-replacement (MIR) data, multiple-anomalous-dispersion (MAD) data and knowledge of non-crystallographic symmetry. The convergence properties and the limiting accuracy of the method are discussed. Its power for synthetic problems is demonstrated and the method is applied to experimentally measured MIR data from kinesin, a motor protein domain that has recently been solved. Appendix A gives a detailed description of the algorithms and the equations used in {\it EDEN}, the computer program that implements the holographic method.},

A general method for calculating the most probable phase is described and applied to the higher- dimensional problem of phase determination for twinned structures. A method for calculating the best phase with intensity data from twinned crystals is also presented. The dependences of these phasing procedures on the number of derivatives and accuracy of the data sets are evaluated in test calculations.},

  abstract  = {In experimental research referencing two or more measurements to one another is a powerful tool to reduce the effect of systematic errors between different sets of measurements. The interesting quantity is usually derived from two measurements on the same sample under different conditions. While an elaborate experimental design is essential for improving the estimate, the data analysis should also maximally exploit the covariance between the measurements. In X-ray crystallography the difference between structure-factor amplitudes carries important information to solve experimental phasing problems or to determine time-dependent structural changes in pump{--}probe experiments. Here a multivariate Bayesian method was used to analyse intensity measurement pairs to determine their underlying structure-factor amplitudes and their differences. The posterior distribution of the model parameter was approximated with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The described merging method is shown to be especially advantageous when systematic and random errors result in recording negative intensity measurements.},
  annote    = {They used pyMC3. The NUTS sampler was unstable with this problem, so they abandoned it. Their optimistic comments about other approximate Bayeisan approaches belie their ignorance. I now think that the way forward is to apply an observation model to the negative intensities problem and a state model to for the expected values. According to Randy Read, the problem with the Wilson and French approach with weak data is that the Wilson distriubiton used for the prior dominates. Maybe a Heirarchical model would do the trick because a different prior could be used or maybe an objective Bayesian approach could be take where the prior differs for each reflection. Another approach would be to toss out the weak data and the determine the substructure with strongest differences. You only need several hundred reflections. So how do you handle the situation of merging multiple observations? Katona is the PI. He has a half dozen people in his group. Their basic idea was to treat the F1 and F2 as part of a bivariate joint normal distribution. I tried to reproduce their work in R on 8 August 2016. See my 750words entry.},

  abstract  = {Bayesian statistical methods have become widely used
                  for data analysis and modelling in recent years, and
                  the BUGS software has become the most popular software
                  for Bayesian analysis worldwide. Authored by the team
                  that originally developed this software, The BUGS Book
                  provides a practical introduction to this program and
                  its use. The text presents complete coverage of all
                  the functionalities of BUGS, including prediction,
                  missing data, model criticism, and prior
                  sensitivity. It also features a large number of worked
                  examples and a wide range of applications from various
                  disciplines. The book introduces regression models,
                  techniques for criticism and comparison, and a wide
                  range of modelling issues before going into the vital
                  area of hierarchical models, one of the most common
                  applications of Bayesian methods. It deals with
                  essentials of modelling without getting bogged down in
                  complexity. The book emphasises model criticism, model
                  comparison, sensitivity analysis to alternative
                  priors, and thoughtful choice of prior
                  distributions---all those aspects of the ``art'' of
                  modelling that are easily overlooked in more
                  theoretical expositions. More pragmatic than
                  ideological, the authors systematically work through
                  the large range of ``tricks'' that reveal the real
                  power of the BUGS software, for example, dealing with
                  missing data, censoring, grouped data, prediction,
                  ranking, parameter constraints, and so on. Many of the
                  examples are biostatistical, but they do not require
                  domain knowledge and are generalisable to a wide range
                  of other application areas. Full code and data for
                  examples, exercises, and some solutions can be found

  abstract = {Summary: Complex formation and conformational transitions of biological macromolecules in solution can be effectively studied using the information about overall shape and size provided by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Hybrid modeling is often applied to integrate high-resolution models into SAXS data analysis. To facilitate this task, we present SASpy, a PyMOL plugin that provides an easy-to-use graphical interface for SAXS-based hybrid modeling. Through a few mouse clicks in SASpy, low-resolution models can be superimposed to high-resolution structures, theoretical scattering profiles and fits can be calculated and displayed on-the-fly. Mouse-based manual rearrangements of complexes are conveniently applied to rapidly check and interactively refine tentative models. Interfaces to automated rigid-body and flexible refinement of macromolecular models against the experimental SAXS data are provided.Availability: SASpy is available as open source at: github.com/emblsaxs/saspy/.

both PyMOL (www.pymol.org) and ATSAS (www.embl-hamburg.de/biosaxs/download.html) are required.Contact: apanjkovich@embl-hamburg.de, svergun@embl-hamburg.de},

  annote    = {"Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was developed to generate a distribution of collections of parameter values from a multidimensional distribution. A square grid containing possible sample points is a Latin square iff there is only one sample in each row and each column. A Latin hypercube is the generalisation of this concept to an arbitrary number of dimensions. When sampling a function of k variables, the range of each variable is divided into n equally probable intervals. n sample points are then drawn such that a Latin Hypercube is created. Latin Hypercube sampling generates more efficient estimates of desired parameters than simple Monte Carlo sampling. This program generates a Latin Hypercube Sample by creating random permutations of the first n integers in each of k columns and then transforming those integers into n sections of a standard uniform distribution. Random values are then sampled from within each of the n sections. Once the sample is generated, the uniform sample from a column can be transformed to any distribution by using the quantile functions, e.g. qnorm(). Different columns can have different distributions. S-optimality seeks to maximize the mean distance from each design point to all the other points in the design, so the points are as spread out as possible. This function uses the CP algorithm to generate an optimal design with respect to the S optimality criterion." See Stocki, R. (2005) A method to improve design reliability using optimal Latin hypercube sampling Computer Assisted Mechanics and Engineering Sciences 12, 87â105.},

  abstract = {Abstract \{NMR\} and \{SAXS\} (small-angle X-ray scattering)/WAXS (wide-angle X-ray scattering) are highly complementary approaches for the analysis of \{RNA\} structure in solution. Here we describe an efficient NMR SAXS/WAXS approach for structural investigation of multi-helical RNAs. We illustrate this approach by determining the overall fold of a 92-nt 3-helix junction from the U4/U6 di-snRNA. The U4/U6 di-snRNA is conserved in eukaryotes and is part of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP, a large ribonucleoprotein complex that comprises a major subunit of the assembled spliceosome. Helical orientations can be determined by X-ray scattering data alone, but the addition of \{NMR\} \{RDC\} (residual dipolar coupling) restraints improves the structure models. \{RDCs\} were measured in two different external alignment media and also by magnetic susceptibility anisotropy. The resulting alignment tensors are collinear, which is a previously noted problem for nucleic acids. Including \{WAXS\} data in the calculations produces models with significantly better fits to the scattering data. In solution, the U4/U6 di-snRNA forms a 3-helix junction with a planar Y-shaped structure and has no detectable tertiary interactions. Single-molecule Forrster resonance energy transfer data support the observed topology. A comparison with the recently determined cryo-electron microscopy structure of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP illustrates how proteins scaffold the \{RNA\} and dramatically alter the geometry of the U4/U6 3-helix junction. },

  annote    = {The crystallographic diffraction experiment measures Bragg intensities; crystallo­graphic electron-density maps and other crystallographic calculations in phasing require structure-factor amplitudes. If data were measured with no errors, the structure-factor amplitudes would be trivially proportional to the square roots of the intensities. When the experimental errors are large, and especially when random errors yield negative net intensities, the conversion of intensities and their error estimates into amplitudes and associated error estimates becomes nontrivial. Although this problem has been addressed intermittently in the history of crystallographic phasing, current approaches to accounting for experimental errors in macromolecular crystallography have numerous significant defects. These have been addressed with the formulation of LLGI, a log-likelihood-gain function in terms of the Bragg intensities and their associated experimental error estimates. LLGI has the correct asymptotic behaviour for data with large experimental error, appropriately downweighting these reflections without introducing bias. LLGI abrogates the need for the conversion of intensity data to amplitudes, which is usually performed with the French and Wilson method [French \& Wilson (1978[French, S. \& Wilson, K. (1978). Acta Cryst. A34, 517-525.]), Acta Cryst. A35, 517–525], wherever likelihood target functions are required. It has general applicability for a wide variety of algorithms in macromolecular crystallography, including scaling, characterizing anisotropy and translational noncrystallographic symmetry, detecting outliers, experimental phasing, molecular replacement and refinement. Because it is impossible to reliably recover the original intensity data from amplitudes, it is suggested that crystallographers should always deposit the intensity data in the Protein Data Bank.},

  abstract = {Phasing of nucleic acid crystal diffraction data using the anomalous signal of phosphorus, P-SAD, at Cukα wavelength has been previously demonstrated using Z-DNA. Since the original work on P-SAD with Z-DNA there has been, with a notable exception, a conspicuous absence of applications of the technique to additional nucleic acid crystal structures. We have reproduced the P-SAD phasing of Z-DNA using a rotating-anode source and have attempted to phase a variety of nucleic acid crystals using P-SAD without success. A comparison of P-SAD using Z-DNA and a representative nucleic acid, the Dickerson-Drew dodecamer, is presented along with a S-SAD using only two sulfurs to phase a 2’-thio modified DNA decamer. A theoretical explanation for the limitation of P-SAD applied to nucleic acids is presented to show that the relatively high atomic displacement parameter of phosphorus in the nucleic acid backbone is responsible for the lack of success in applying P-SAD to nucleic acid diffraction data.},
  annote   = {I spent an hour reading the paper by Joel Harp and Martin Egli of the failure of of P-phasing of B-form DNA. I had selected as an example paper from Crystals. This is a surprisingly good paper. Of course, this paper meets Martin Egli's standard of excellence. This paper does describe their success at P-SAD phasing an RNA with two sulfurs incorporated. They also have success at Direct Methods with SIR2004 but they did not mention success with shelxd. Their analysis was extensive of relative phosphorous mobility is heroic. They even attempted 10,000 structure determination with ShelxE! This paper is very relevant to my PSAD and ISAD phasing paper. Their introduction has an excellent description of why nucleic acids are difficult to derivative. They also compare delta B of sulfur and phosphorous atoms versus the light atoms for proteins and nucleic acids. They found that sulfurs in proteins on average have lower B-values while phosphorous atoms in nucleic acids have higher B-values. They attribute the failure to the greater mobility of the phosphates compared to the other atoms as assessed from the B-values. I suspect that A-form helices will show less mobility in the phosphates. They also have a nice review of progress with XFELS.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:High-throughput bioinformatic analysis tools are needed
to mine the large amount of structural data via knowledge based approaches.
The development of such tools requires a robust interface to access
the structural data in an easy way. For this the Python scripting
language is the optimal choice since its philosophy is to write an
understandable source code.RESULTS:p3d is an object oriented Python
module that adds a simple yet powerful interface to the Python interpreter
to process and analyse three dimensional protein structure files
(PDB files). p3d's strength arises from the combination of a) very
fast spatial access to the structural data due to the implementation
of a binary space partitioning (BSP) tree, b) set theory and c) functions
that allow to combine a and b and that use human readable language
in the search queries rather than complex computer language. All
these factors combined facilitate the rapid development of bioinformatic
tools that can perform quick and complex analyses of protein structures.CONCLUSION:p3d
is the perfect tool to quickly develop tools for structural bioinformatics
using the Python scripting language.},

  abstract  = {A novel approach is presented for an a priori assessment of the ambiguity associated with spherically averaged single-particle scattering. The approach is of broad interest to the structural biology community, allowing the rapid and model-independent assessment of the inherent non-uniqueness of three-dimensional shape reconstruction from scattering experiments on solutions of biological macromolecules. One-dimensional scattering curves recorded from monodisperse systems are nowadays routinely utilized to generate low-resolution particle shapes, but the potential ambiguity of such reconstructions remains a major issue. At present, the (non)uniqueness can only be assessed by a posteriori comparison and averaging of repetitive Monte Carlo-based shape-determination runs. The new a priori ambiguity measure is based on the number of distinct shape categories compatible with a given data set. For this purpose, a comprehensive library of over 14,000 shape topologies has been generated containing up to seven beads closely packed on a hexagonal grid. The computed scattering curves rescaled to keep only the shape topology rather than the overall size information provide a `scattering map' of this set of shapes. For a given scattering data set, one rapidly obtains the number of neighbours in the map and the associated shape topologies such that in addition to providing a quantitative ambiguity measure the algorithm may also serve as an alternative shape-analysis tool. The approach has been validated in model calculations on geometrical bodies and its usefulness is further demonstrated on a number of experimental X-ray scattering data sets from proteins in solution. A quantitative ambiguity score (a-score) is introduced to provide immediate and convenient guidance to the user on the uniqueness of the ab initio shape reconstruction from the given data set.

  abstract = { Introduction: X-ray crystallography provides the majority of our structural biological knowledge at a molecular level and, in terms of pharmaceutical design, is a valuable tool to accelerate discovery. It is the premier technique in the field, but its usefulness is significantly limited by the need to grow well-diffracting crystals. It is for this reason that high-throughput crystallization has become a key technology that has matured over the past 10 years through the field of structural genomics. Areas covered : The authors describe their experiences in high-throughput crystallization screening in the context of structural genomics and the general biomedical community. They focus on the lessons learnt from the operation of a high-throughput crystallization-screening laboratory, which to date has screened over 12,500 biological macromolecules. They also describe the approaches taken to maximize the success while minimizing the effort. Through this, the authors hope that the reader will gain an insight into the efficient design of a laboratory and protocols to accomplish high-throughput crystallization on a single-, multiuser laboratory or industrial scale. Expert opinion : High-throughput crystallization screening is readily available but, despite the power of the crystallographic technique, getting crystals is still not a solved problem. High-throughput approaches can help when used skillfully; however, they still require human input in the detailed analysis and interpretation of results to be more successful. },

As neutron sources are becoming more available to general users, finding means to optimize the growth of protein crystals to sizes suitable for NMC is extremely important. Historically, much has been learned about growing crystals for X-ray diffraction. However, owing to new-generation synchrotron X-ray facilities and sensitive detectors, protein crystal sizes as small as in the nano-range have become adequate for structure determination, lessening the necessity to grow large crystals. Here, some of the approaches, techniques and considerations for the growth of crystals to significant dimensions that are now relevant to NMC are revisited. These include experimental strategies utilizing solubility diagrams, ripening effects, classical crystallization techniques, microgravity and theoretical considerations.},

  abstract  = { We describe NIMBLE, a system for programming statistical algorithms for general model structures within R. NIMBLE is designed to meet three challenges: flexible model specification, a language for programming algorithms that can use different models, and a balance between high-level programmability and execution efficiency. For model specification, NIMBLE extends the BUGS language and creates model objects, which can manipulate variables, calculate log probability values, generate simulations, and query the relationships among variables. For algorithm programming, NIMBLE provides functions that operate with model objects using two stages of evaluation. The first stage allows specialization of a function to a particular model and/or nodes, such as creating a Metropolis-Hastings sampler for a particular block of nodes. The second stage allows repeated execution of computations using the results of the first stage. To achieve efficient second-stage computation, NIMBLE compiles models and functions via C++, using the Eigen library for linear algebra, and provides the user with an interface to compiled objects. The NIMBLE language represents a compilable domain-specific language (DSL) embedded within R. This paper provides an overview of the design and rationale for NIMBLE along with illustrative examples including importance sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Monte Carlo expectation maximization (MCEM). },

The conditions are later adjusted to the metastable zone by direct dilution. The added volume varied from 10 to 30% ofthe total drop volume immediately after dilution. Over 90% of the crystals from droplets set in the nucleation zone were useless for diffracton studies. In contrast, >60% of the crystals grown from the metastable zone yield diffraction quality crystals. In parallel experiments, they varied the time that the drop was in the nucleation zone (1,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,19,20,48 h). In general, shorter times led to fewer and larger crystals along with more clear drops. The reproducibility in determining the boundaries of the nucleation zone is limited by a number of experimental errors: the surfaces on which crystals growth, the action of bacteria in the drop, errors in pH of the buffer, temperature fluctuations, pipetting errors, errors in the concentration of the RNA, errors in the concentration of the chemical components, and so on.},

  annote    = {The experiments with two proteins working with molar concentrations of ammonium sulfate show that the determination of the supersolublity curve of a working phase diagram is sufficient to the successful decoupling of nucleation from crystal growth. The authors argue that inclusion of the determination of the solubility curve to obtain a complete phase diagram takes a lot more material and time. The cost of the ignorance of the solubility curve is to transfer crystallization drops to reservoirs that support undersaturated conditions that yield no crystals rather than metastable conditions that support further crystal growth. Multiple experiments were done in duplicate and triplicate. The initial crystallization drop was placed over a solution containing 33\% to 83\% higher precipitant concentration. The idea was to induce nucleation just long enough to form a few crystal nuclei. The nucleation times tested for trypsin were 0, 2.5, 4.5, 6, 7, and 9 h. The times tested for C-phycocyanin were 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 7 h. They authors do not show the results by nucleation time. Instead, they just report examples of experimental parameter combinations that gave crystals that diffracted X-rays well. The controls consisted of drops below that supersolubility curve that were not incubated and that did not give crystals in 3 weeks. Some of these drops gave crystals after 6-8 weeks, probably due to evaporation from the chamber. A second set of controls consisted of leaving the drops over the conditions above the supersolubility curve. These controls usually gave clusters of crystals. In another set of experiments with C-phycoyanin and $\alpha$-crustacyanin, which were not described in the Materials and Methods, they investigated the effect of drop volume and reservoir to drop volume ratio. Drops volumes in the range of 2-6 uL gave similar results on a per unit drop volume ratio. In other words, there was not a decrease in the number of crystals per unit volume with larger drop volume. Reservoir to drop volume ratios below 67:1 gave larger numbers of smaller crystals and slowed down the time to appearance of the crystals. Higher ratios had no effect. Volumes under 300 uL did not cover the bottom of the well whereas larger volumes did do so. The surface area and surface tension of the well solution may have been the more important parameters than well volume per se. I conclude that you shoudl always use drops larger than 2 uL and reservoirs larger than 300 uL.},

Since the structural features of RNA are of major importance to their biological function, there is much interest in predicting RNA structure, either in free form or in interaction with various ligands, including proteins, metabolites and other molecules. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have developed novel RNA algorithms for predicting RNA secondary and tertiary structures. In this review, we describe current experimental and computational advances and discuss recent ideas that are transforming the traditional view of RNA folding. To evaluate the performance of the most recent RNA 3D folding algorithms, we provide a comparative study in order to test the performance of available 3D structure prediction algorithms for an RNA data set of 43 structures of various lengths and motifs. We find that the algorithms vary widely in terms of prediction quality across different RNA lengths and topologies; most predictions have very large root mean square deviations from the experimental structure. We conclude by outlining some suggestions for future RNA folding research.},

It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of

obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within
a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing
methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the “nested” contours of
likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic relabelling)
allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which
effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

We implement a new evidence algorithm known as nested sampling, which combines accuracy, generality of application, and computational feasibility, and we apply it to some cosmological data sets and models.

Without advance knowledge of the shape of the virus and only approximate knowledge of its size, the virus can be modeled as the symmetry expansion of a short list of nearly tetrahedrally arranged lattice points which coarsely, but uniformly, sample the icosahedrally unique volume. The number of lattice points depends on an estimate of the non-redundant information content at the working resolution limit. This parameterization permits a simple matrix formulation of the model evaluation calculation, resulting in a highly efficient survey of the space of possible models. Initially, one bit per parameter is sufficient, since the assignment of ones and zeros to the lattice points yields a physically reasonable low-resolution image of the virus. The best candidate solutions identified by the survey are refined to relax the constraints imposed by the coarseness of the modeling, and then trials whose intensity-based statistics are comparatively good in all resolution ranges are chosen. This yields an acceptable starting point for symmetry-based direct phase extension about half the time. Improving efficiency by incorporating the selection criterion directly into the genetic algorithm's fitness function is discussed.},

  abstract  = {Ab initio phasing by direct computational methods in low-resolution X-ray crystallography is a long-standing challenge. A common approach is to consider it as two subproblems: sampling of phase space and identification of the correct solution. While the former is amenable to a myriad of search algorithms, devising a reliable target function for the latter problem remains an open question. Here, recent developments in CrowdPhase, a collaborative online game powered by a genetic algorithm that evolves an initial population of individuals with random genetic make-up (i.e. random phases) each expressing a phenotype in the form of an electron-density map, are presented. Success relies on the ability of human players to visually evaluate the quality of these maps and, following a Darwinian survival-of-the-fittest concept, direct the search towards optimal solutions. While an initial study demonstrated the feasibility of the approach, some important crystallographic issues were overlooked for the sake of simplicity. To address these, the new CrowdPhase includes consideration of space-group symmetry, a method for handling missing amplitudes, the use of a map correlation coefficient as a quality metric and a solvent-flattening step. Performances of this installment are discussed for two low-resolution test cases based on bona fide diffraction data. },

The bottom line message is there are incentives to continue to use bad research methods in spite of calls for better methods over the past several decades. This has lead to \emph{the natural selection of bad science}. The natural selection of bad science is driven by publication being the principle factor in career advancement. Some normative methods of data analysis are used to promote publication rather than advancement of understanding. This paper presents a meta-analysis of statistical power in 60-years of research in the behavorial sciences. They find that the selection for high output leads to poor methods and increasingly high rates of false discovery. The replication of results slows but does not stop the deterioration of methods. They conclude that institutional changes are required to improve the quality of research.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:
Traditional calculations of sample size do not formally incorporate uncertainty about the likely effect size. Use of a normal prior to express that uncertainty, as recently recommended, can lead to power that does not approach 1 as the sample size approaches infinity.
PURPOSE:
To provide approaches for calculating sample size and power that formally incorporate uncertainty about effect size. The relevant formulas should ensure that power approaches one as sample size increases indefinitely and should be easy to calculate.
METHODS:
We examine normal, truncated normal, and gamma priors for effect size computationally and demonstrate analytically an approach to approximating the power for a truncated normal prior. We also propose a simple compromise method that requires a moderately larger sample size than the one derived from the fixed effect method.
RESULTS:
Use of a realistic prior distribution instead of a fixed treatment effect is likely to increase the sample size required for a Phase 3 trial. The standard fixed effect method for moving from estimates of effect size obtained in a Phase 2 trial to the sample size of a Phase 3 trial ignores the variability inherent in the estimate from Phase 2. Truncated normal priors appear to require unrealistically large sample sizes while gamma priors appear to place too much probability on large effect sizes and therefore produce unrealistically high power.
LIMITATIONS:
The article deals with a few examples and a limited range of parameters. It does not deal explicitly with binary or time-to-failure data.
CONCLUSIONS:
Use of the standard fixed approach to sample size calculation often yields a sample size leading to lower power than desired. Other natural parametric priors lead either to unacceptably large sample sizes or to unrealistically high power. We recommend an approach that is a compromise between assuming a fixed effect size and assigning a normal prior to the effect size.

The paper treats directly the issues of overdispersion and excess zeros that make count data too liberal. After eight pages of review, it compares several models with one example from health economics. Exploratory data analysis is done in before model fitting. Then the poisson regression, quasipoisson, negative binomial regression, hurdle regression, and zero-inflated regression are done one at a time. Finally, the models are compared. The modeled mean functions were similar, but the fitted likelihood is different. As a result, the models differ with respect to explaining overdispersion and the number of zero counts. The negative binomial model has the advantage of having a formal likelihood. As a result, information criteria are available and the expected number of zeros can be computed from the fitted density via $\sum_i f(0,\hat{\mu_i},\hat{\theta_i})$.},

  abstract  = {Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a group of mathematical and statistical methods used for exploring the optimum operating conditions through statistical design of experiments. Obtaining the suitable analytical model between input variables and one or more responses is the main stage in RSM studies. When the response has replications, these replicated values may cause error. The proper modeling approach should be preferred according to the source of error, which is randomness or measurement error. In this study, Bayesian approach and fuzzy approach are used to estimate the model parameters in which the error becomes randomness and measurement error, respectively. The novelty of this study is analysis of response surface model parameters, which are obtained by using Bayesian approach and fuzzy approach, through interval analysis. The interpretation of model parameters and the comparison of modeling approaches are evaluated by interval arithmetic metrics. The suggested approaches are applied on replicated response measured two data sets and the results are discussed.

using the method of molecular replacement, in which known
related structures are rotated and translated to provide an initial
atomic model for the new structure. A theoretical understanding
of the signal-to-noise ratio in likelihood-based molecular replacement
searches has been developed to account for the influence of
model quality and completeness, as well as the resolution of the
diffraction data. Here we show that, contrary to current belief,
molecular replacement need not be restricted to the use of models
comprising a substantial fraction of the unknown structure. Instead,
likelihood-based methods allow a continuum of applications
depending predictably on the quality of the model and the
resolution of the data. Unexpectedly, our understanding of the
signal-to-noise ratio in molecular replacement leads to the finding
that, with data to sufficiently high resolution, fragments as small
as single atoms of elements usually found in proteins can yield ab
initio solutions of macromolecular structures, including some that
elude traditional direct metods.},

  abstract  = {Here, a case is presented of an unusual structure determination which was facilitated by the use of pseudosymmetry. Group A streptococcus uses cysteine protease Mac-1 (also known as IdeS) to evade the host immune system. Native Mac-1 was crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P21212. Surprisingly, crystals of the inactive C94A mutant of Mac-1 displayed monoclinic symmetry with space group P21, despite the use of native orthorhombic Mac-1 micro- crystals for seeding. Attempts to solve the structure of the C94A mutant by MAD phasing in the monoclinic space group did not produce an interpretable map. The native Patterson map of the C94A mutant showed two strong peaks along the (1 0 1) diagonal, indicating possible translational pseudosymmetry in space group P21. Interestingly, one-third of the monoclinic reflections obeyed pseudo-orthorhombic P21212 symmetry similar to that of the wild-type crystals and could be indexed and processed in this space group. The pseudo- orthorhombic and monoclinic unit cells were related by the following vector operations: am = bo 􏰀 co, bm = ao and cm = 􏰀2co 􏰀 bo. The pseudo-orthorhombic subset of data produced good SAD phases, leading to structure determination with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Subsequently, the structure of the Mac-1 mutant in the monoclinic form was determined by molecular replacement, which showed six molecules forming three translationally related dimers aligned along the (1 0 1) diagonal. Knowing the geometric relationship between the pseudo-orthorhombic and the monoclinic unit cells, all six molecules can be generated in the monoclinic unit cell directly without the use of molecular replacement. The current case provides a successful example of the use of pseudosymmetry as a powerful phase-averaging method for structure determination by anomalous diffraction techniques. In particular, a structure can be solved in a higher pseudosymmetry subcell in which an NCS operator becomes a crystallographic operator. The geometrical relationships between the subcell and parental cell can be used to generate a complete molecular representation of the parental asymmetric unit for refinement.},

They had to develop some unique algorithms that make Stan useful for other kinds of computation outsdie of Bayeisan inference. The article then walks through a simple Bernoulli example with count data. This is the first turn of the learning spiral. Their discussion includes an analysis of the the output from the sampler, posterior mode estimates, and diagnosis of the log probability and gradient calculations. Then the article reviews the Stan modeling language and how compiled models are executed. They first cover a hierachical bionmial model with posterior inferences. The discussion includes what to do with non-centered parameterizations. One probably want to compare non-centered parameters and parameterized models on their own. Betacourt and Girolami (2013) found that non-centered models are best when the dat are sparse and centered are best whne the dta stronly identifies the coefficients. Next, data types in Stan are reviewed. This is followed by a discussion of Stan syntax in terms of expressions and type inference. Next, two kinds of statements are distinguished. This is followed by a presentation of the function and distribution library. Next, the HMC and HM samplers are presented along with three optimizers: BFGS, congugate gradient, and accelerated gradient. Next, random number generators are discussed. Stan is dependent on two external libraries: Boost and Eigen. Finally, the developer process is reviewed. This consists of version control on GitHub, continuous integration, testing framework, and build. Figures 6-14 are tables of parameters in Stan. },

  abstract  = {A simple relation exists between the packing density in crystals of short A-DNA duplexes and their global double-helical structure. The volume per nucleotide pair shows a linear inverse correlation with the mean displacement of base pairs from the best straight helix axis. The mean displacement is a measure of major groove depth and varies between -3.3 A and -4.9 A in A-form oligonucleotides analysed in the crystalline state. Since the mean displacement of base pairs from the helix axis determines other helical parameters such as base-pair longitudinal slide, its correlation with crystal packing is of considerable interest. The displacement-packing correlation is very clear for octamer duplexes which crystallize in three different lattices. Longer A-helical fragments sometimes deviate from the rule. It may be speculated whether A-form duplexes not completing a full helical turn are especially prone to distortions due to packing in crystals or arising from intermolecular contacts in solution.},

This book is an absolute treasure for anyone using Generalized LMs for research or work. Hardin lays out the details behind the development and application of GLMs and their extensions in a clear and straightforward way. The book does require prior knowledge of regression and familiarity with concepts such as matrix algebra, integrals and derivatives. It balances the theory, application and Stata programming beautifully! Understanding the family and link functions is absolutely necessary when building GLMs. The explanations are very clear. James Hardin is not of Hardin and Slaone fame.S},

Ecological data often vary considerably, and traditional approaches are likely to be inefficient or incorrect due to underestimation of uncertainty and poor predictive power. We propose a new statistical model to account for excessive overdisperson. It is the combination of two negative binomial models, where the first determines the number of clusters and the second the number of individuals in each cluster. Simulations show that this model often performs better than the negative binomial model. This model also fitted catch and effort data for southern bluefin tuna better than other models according to AIC. A model that explicitly and properly accounts for overdispersion should contribute to robust management and conservation for wildlife and plants.},

This review examines the role of X-ray crystallography in providing the required structural information and advances in the field of X-ray crystallography that enhance or expand its role. Main methods: X-ray crystallography of new drugs candidates and intermediates can provide valuable information of new syntheses and parameters for quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR). Key findings: Crystallographic studies play a vital role in many disciplines including materials science, chemistry, pharmacology, and molecular biology. X-ray crystallography is the most comprehensive technique available to determine molecular structure. A requirement for the high accuracy of crystallographic structures is that a ‘good crystal’ must be found, and this is often the rate-limiting step. In the past three decades developments in detectors, increases in computer power, and powerful graphics capabilities have contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of materials characterized by X-ray crystallography. More recently the advent of high-throughput crystallization techniques has enhanced our ability to produce that one good crystal required for crystallographic analysis. Significance: Continuing advances in all phases of a crystallographic study have expanded the ranges of samples which can be analyzes by X-ray crystallography to include larger molecules, smaller or weakly diffracting crystals, and twinned crystals.},

Learning their structure and intricacies is fraught with challenges, and often side-stepped in favour of studying the function of different gene products in isolation from their physiological context. Constructing and inferring global mathematical models from experimental data is, however, central to systems biology. Different experimental setups provide different insights into such systems. Here we show how we can combine concepts from Bayesian inference and information theory in order to identify experiments that maximize the information content of the resulting data. This approach allows us to incorporate preliminary information; it is global and not constrained to some local neighbourhood in parameter space and it readily yields information on parameter robustness and confidence. Here we develop the theoretical framework and apply it to a range of exemplary problems that highlight how we can improve experimental investigations into the structure and dynamics of biological systems and their behavior.},

  abstract  = {Protein solubility is a key parameter affecting the performance of every biotechnological downstream processing operation. Current methods used to determine protein solubility data, however, are often characterized by the need of pure protein crystals and long experimental time frames lying in the range of weeks to months, while other methods often fail to reach the solubility limits due to a too high dilution during the generation of the respective experimental solutions. This article presents an efficient, high throughput compatible methodâbased on photometric turbidity measurementsâwhich allows a gentle and controlled concentration of the solution while constantly analyzing the solution state. All experimental tools were developed using the robotic liquid handling station Tecan Freedom Evo 200. The ability to combine sample concentration and solution state analysis acts as a basis for the determination of process relevant solubility phase diagrams and analysis of relevant kinetic effects during precipitation. Effects of several buffers on protein solubility and solubility curves of different insulin variants are shown as examples of relevant screening parameters. },

The standard confidence regions for the stationary point are due to Box \& Hunter (1954). The authors propose an alternative parametrization, in which the stationary point is the parameter of interest; likelihood techniques and Bayesian analysis are then easier to perform. The authors also suggest an approximate method to get highest posterior density regions for the maximum point (not simply for the stationary point). Furthermore, they study the coverage probabilities of these Bayesian regions through simulations.''},

The major contribution of this paper is the fact that it provides a novel optimization scheme integrating a loss function approach with a posterior predictive approach in a single framework of Bayesian modeling and optimization. The proposed approach not only considers the correlation among multiple responses and the uncertainty of model parameters, but also takes into account quality loss (bias and robustness) and reliability of the optimization results. The illustrative example also shows that the proposed approach can give more reasonable results than the existing approaches when both quality loss and reliability of optimization results are important issues. In addition, the Bayesian optimization approach using Monte Carlo simulation and hybrid genetic algorithm can quickly calculate the quality loss and posterior probability of the optimal parameter setting, which is also applicable to other multi-response optimization problems. It should be noted that the proposed optimization strategy is also applicable to other operational research optimization problems such as stochastic stock problem and supply chain optimization problem.},

Here a convenient screening strategy is studied in detail that varies the volume ratio of protein sample to the reservoir solution in the drop to initiate crystallization that is named "composition modification". It is applied after the first screen and has been studied with twelve proteins. Statistical analysis shows a significant improvement in screening using this strategy. The average improvement of "hits" at different temperatures is between 32 and 42%, for examples, 41.8% ± 14.0% and 35.7% ± 12.4% (± standard deviation) at 288 K and 300 K, respectively. Remarkably, some new crystals were found by composition modification which increased the probability of reaching the nucleation zone to initiate crystallization. This was confirmed by a phase diagram study. It is also demonstrated that composition modification can further increase crystallisation success significantly (1.3 times) after the improvement of "hits" by temperature screening. The trajectories of different composition modifications during vapour diffusion were plotted, further demonstrating that protein crystallizability can be increased by hitting more parts of the nucleation zone. It was also found to facilitate the finding of initial crystals for proteins of low solubility. These proteins gradually become more concentrated during the vapour diffusion process starting from a larger protein solution ratio in the initial mixture.},

Simulation is introduced early to give a feel for randomness, and later used for inference. There are major chapters on linear and nonlinear regression and on Bayesian ideas, the latter sketching modern computational techniques. Each chapter has a wide range of examples intended to showthe interplay of subject-matter, mathematical, and computational considerations that makes statisticalwork so varied, so challenging, and so fascinating.},

Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques useful for the modeling and analysis of problems. By careful design of experiments, the objective is to optimize a response (output variable) which is influenced by several independent variables (input variables). An experiment is a series of tests, called runs, in which changes are made in the input variables in order to identify the reasons for changes in the output response. It is the process of identifying and fitting an approximate response surface model from input and output data obtained from experimental studies or from the numerical analysis where each run can be regarded as an experiment.},

Once a list of potential factors is identified from subject‐matter expertise, the strengths of the associations between those factors and the target attributes need to be quantified. A naïve, one‐factor‐at‐a‐time analysis would require many more trials than necessary. Additionally, it would not yield information about whether the relationship between a factor and the target depends on the values of other factors (commonly referred to as interaction effects between factors). As demonstrated in Douglas Montgomery’s Design and Analysis of Experiments textbook, principles of statistical theory, linear algebra, and analysis guide the development of efficient experimental designs for factor settings. Once a subset of important factors has been isolated, subsequent experimentation can determine the settings of those factors that will optimize the target quality attributes. Fortunately, modern software has taken advantage of the advanced theory. This software now facilitates the development of good design and makes solid analysis more accessible to those with a minimal statistical background.},

  author    = {Huang, Kai-Zhu and Yang, Haiqin and Lyu, Michael R},
  annote    = {The objective of this book is to establish a framework which combines two different paradigms in machine learning: global learning and local learning. The combined model demonstrates that a hybrid learning of these two different schools of approaches can outperform each isolated approach both theoretically and empirically. Global learning focuses on describing a phenomenon or modeling data in a global way. For example, a distribution over the variables is usually estimated for summarizing the data. Its output can usually reconstruct the data. This school of approaches, including Bayesian Networks [8, 13, 30], Gaussian Mixture Models [3, 21], and Hidden Markov Models [2, 25], has a long and distinguished history, which has been extensively applied in artificial intelligence [26], pattern recognition [9], and computer vision [7]. On the other hand, local learning does not intend to summarize a phenomenon, but builds learning systems by concentrating on some local parts of data. It lacks the flexibility yet surprisingly demonstrates superior performance to global learning according to recent researches [4, 16, 15]. In this book, a bridge has been established between these two different paradigms. Moreover, the resulting principled framework subsumes several important models, which respectively locate themselves into the global learning paradigm and the local learning paradigm.},
